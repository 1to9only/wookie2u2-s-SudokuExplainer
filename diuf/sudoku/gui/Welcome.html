If you're having trouble reading this then right-click in this hint details
area (ie here) to copy the HTML to the clipboard, paste it into temp.html and
open it in your browser, which will allow you to enlarge the font. The hints
TreeView (upper right) also has this right-click to copy feature. If the GUI
fonts are too small then all I can offer is Windows magnifying glass, it's in
accessibility settings. Sorry I can't be more help: GUI's just s__t me.

<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>
<b>Sudoku Explainer</b> tries to cater for everyone who's interested in Sudoku
puzzles, from wee gromets up to Western European university professors, but the
focus is on hard (ie beyond a humans ability to solve) puzzles.
<p>
The Techniques herein have been described as "old school". That's fine with me.
I've added techniques from HoDoKu and Sukaku in order to mitigate this valid
criticism. They're not faster, they're just simpler. My initial focus was TOO
performance-centric. The downside is you'll probably want to unwant slow techs.
<p>
<b>Sudoku Explainer</b> shows you how to solve any Sudoku puzzle step by step,
explaining each solving technique as it's applied. It also allows you to get
<b><i>all</i></b> the hints (ie solving techniques) that can be applied to a
puzzle, and to apply any or all of them (singularly or multiply).
<p>
<b>Sudoku Explainer</b> solves "the worlds hardest Sudoku puzzle" according to
conceptis.com in 125.610 seconds with all A*E's enabled and unhacked on my i7
(see the Solving techniques section below for my config preferences):
<pre>
8..........36......7..9.2...5...7.......457.....1...3...1....68..85...1..9....4..
(copy-and-paste this puzzle (Edit menu ~ Paste grid) then press F9 to analyse).
</pre>
<p>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>
If you just want a bit of help with a puzzle then the first step is punching
it in. Either left-click on the small grey digit (the maybe) so set the cells
value, or with the keyboard: navigate to the cell-to-be-set with the arrow-keys
and then press the digit key: 1..9.
<p>
Spacebar, delete, backspace, or 0 (zero) all clear the current cell value.
If you stuff-up then Ctrl-Z goes back one step at a time. Ctrl-Y does a redo.
<p>
When you've got your whole puzzle punched-in press Ctrl-S to save. Now's a good
time to double-check that the puzzle is punched-in 100% correctly, before you
start solving it. A reload might be handy later.
<p>
Press F7 to validate: ie check it has one and only one solution. I have seen
published Sudoku's with insufficient clues; some idiot rushing to meet a
deadline.
<p>
If you get stuck press F5 for a hint. To apply that hint and get the next one
just press enter.
<p>
Anyway, that's probably enough to get you started. Have fun with it. Come back
and read the advanced stuff when your tennis elbow flares up (get bored).
<p>
<h2>Advanced Stuff</h2>
<p>
More "advanced" Sudokuists will want to remove maybes (potential values).
That's those small grey digits in the empty cells. To remove a maybe just right
click on the small grey digit; or using the keyboard: select the cell with the
arrow keys and then Ctrl-digit. The same procedure also restores a maybe; just
right-click where it should be. You can't restore an invalid one.
<p>
You'll notice that <b>Sudoku Explainer</b> enforces the basic rule of Sudoku:
<i>"There will be one-and-only-one instance of each value in each region"</i>.
So when you punch a 7 into a cell then all the 7's disappear from the other
cells in it's box (the 3x3 thingummy), row (horizontal), and col (vertical),
and no matter what you do you can't get them back.
<p>
Sudoku puzzle books are all a bit soft (it's an expert scale) so just seeing the
maybes could get you unstuck; but if not then press F5 to find a hint. Then you
can just press enter to apply that hint and get next, and next... Solvered!
<p>
The following "frequently used" <b>buttons</b> are arranged along the bottom
of the form (I don't use the buttons, or the menus. I hope they still work):
<ul>
 <li><b>Clear hints</b> clears the hints tree and refreshes the Sudoku grid.
 <li><b>Solve step</b> applies the selected hint (if any) and gets the next
  (simplest possible) step in solving the puzzle. Click the [Solve step]
  button again to apply the selected hint, and get the next one; or just
  double-click on the hint in the hints tree, or click in the hintsTree (to
  select it) and press enter. That's how to watch a Sudoku puzzle being solved:
  Just Keep Pressing Enter! which takes all the fun out of it really, except
  that SE solves any Sudoku puzzle, even really <i>really</i> <i><b>really</b></i>
  hard ones (like conceptis's above). My challenge is to solve all <u>possible</u>
  Sudoku puzzles as simply as possible to provide a step-by-step explanation;
  and do it all as quickly as possible; just because Sudoku was there.
 <li><b>Get next hint</b> to get hints again without applying the current one.
  Why would you do that? Because there's a button for it, obviously!<br>
 <li><b>Apply hint</b> to apply the current hint, without getting the next one.
  You can select multiple hints in the HintsTree and apply them all with this
  button; or Just Press Enter! Dunno why you'd actually do that, but it is
  possible, because there's a button for it, which is nice really, isn't it.
 <li><b>Get all hints</b> which can be applied to the current grid. Hold down
  the shift key to get even more hints, but be forewarned, this can take a
  minute (or three) on my i7. The HintsTree is grouped by category &amp; hinter, in
  increasing eliminations or difficulty, depending on "Filter Hints".
  Expand each category by clicking on it. Be warned that 20,000+ hints may be
  produced when Filter hints isn't selected, so the GUI bogs down.
  Filter hints checks "does it do anything new", so when a more complex hints
  actions (cells set &amp; maybes eliminated) are already covered by a simpler
  hint then the latter is suppressed, reducing hints, so it won't bog.
 <li>A large Aligned*Exclusion hint takes upto like 10 seconds to DOM-parse
  because of profligate use of color tags. A GUI programmer with HTML/styles
  could help here. I wouldn't have a clue what a style is. I don't have any.
</ul>
<p>
Some other stuff also worth a mention:<ul>
 <li><b>File menu ~ load next Puzzle</b> or just Ctrl-P loads the next puzzle.
  The meaning of "next" depends on what you've got open. The <i>.mt</i> files
  (magic-tour) are a multi-puzzle format, but next on a <i>.txt</i> file opens
  the next text-file in the current directory. <b>NOTE</b> that when you open
  the next puzzle SE analyses the puzzle automatically, which may take a while,
  depending on the difficulty of the puzzle and which Solving Techniques you've
  got enabled (some are MUCH slower than others).
 <li><b>File menu ~ Reload</b> (Alt-F-R) or just Ctrl-R reloads the saved puzzle
  from disk. I find this really handy.
 <li><b>File menu ~ log View</b> for techies: view hints of a type in the .log
  of a previous LogicalSolverTester run, to re/exercise the hinter/s and/or see
  how hinttype/s look in GUI.
 <li><b>Tools menu ~ Reset Potential Values</b> restores the puzzles maybes,
  which is handy if you bugger-it-all-up and want to restore the puzzle to a
  valid state before trying again. Note that reset doesn't remove cell values,
  even if they're wrong. Use Ctrl-Z or Reload for that.
 <li><b>F6 - Get a clue</b> points you towards the next step. Shift-F6 gives
  you a bit more information (it's basically the hint for simpler techniques).
  For harder techniques a clue is the help I think I should want when solving
  a Sudoku manually because it tells me which technique to apply next, allowing
  me to skip all the inapplicable techniques; but what I actually use is the
  hints, but I'm a programmer, so for me the challenge is writing the code to
  produce the hints to solve all Sudoku puzzles, not solving A puzzle, as I
  presume it is for most people. Clues are there if you want them.
 <li><b>F7 - Check validity</b> checks that there are no doubled values; that
  each empty cell has at least 1 potential value; that all regions have a
  possible location for each unplaced value; and finally that the Sudoku has a
  unique (one and only one) solution. This is pretty handy. I'm not really
  surprised (just disgusted) at the prevalence of blatant basic invalidities
  (like 16 clues) in published Sudokus, because idiots are always in a hurry.
  Quality takes time. Get over it.
 <li><b>F9 - Analyse</b> tells you how hard the puzzle is, and summarises the
  steps used to solve it. Note that this is far from the only possible solution
  to the puzzle, it's just <b>a</b> (not THE) simplest recipe using the enabled
  Solving Techniques. There may be other shorter recipes that don't increase the
  difficulty. I'm not seeking the shortest simplest path, just the simplest;
  because that's simpler. Yeah? <i>A*</i>ing chumpy edges scares me.
 <li>If you want an itemised solution then run the LogicalSolverTester over the
  puzzle and look at the log file. That's why I haven't bothered with it in the
  GUI. I figure most users don't want it, and those that do also want a batch.
 <li><b>Options ~ Solving techniques...</b> allows you to select which Sudoku
  solving techniques are applicable:<ul>
   <li>Naked Singles, Hidden Singles, Dynamic Plus and Nested Plus are all
	mandatory, so there CheckBoxes are checked and disabled.
   <li>You can't disable singles because they're "core" techniques. It makes no
	sense to try to solve a Sudoku without them.
   <li>Dynamic Plus is a catch-all. It's a bit slow, but misses only on the
	hardest puzzles. Nested Plus is really slow, mandatory, and ALWAYS hints;
	in fact Nested Unary (faster) also never fails to find a hint, so maybe it
	should be the catch-all instead, except that precludes Nested Multiple and
	Nested Plus, where all the really disenhirsuterative fun is. sigh.
   <li><i>Direct*</i> are useless, but which I mean when they are unchecked the
	hints are still found by there non-direct equivalents. Direct just runs the
	same algorithm twice on each pass, to show hintier ones sooner, which is
	just a waste of time, unless it isn't because that's what you really want.
   <li>Choosing BUG, Coloring, XColoring, Medusa 3D, and/or GEM (Graded
	Equivalence Marks) is pretty complicated, so here's the break down:<ul>
	<li>BUG (Bivalue Universal Grave) is the earliest solving technique; which
	 might reasonably now be regarded as "deprecated" because it's slow and
	 produces minimal hints, but it still works so it remains.
	<li>Coloring implements both Simple Coloring (two colors) and MultiColoring
	 (multiple color-sets). It is faster and finds more hints than BUG. Also it
	 is the ONLY coloring technique that searches multiple color-sets.
	 If Coloring is unwanted then multiple color-set hints are found by the
	 Unary Chainer; they are NOT sought by XColoring, Medusa 3D, or GEM.
	<li>XColoring (Extended Coloring) finds more Simple Coloring hints, but is
	 slower.
	<li>Medusa 3D finds more Simple Coloring hints, but is slower again.
	<li>GEM (Graded Equivalence Marks) is the "ultimate" simple coloring.
	 It finds a superset of Medusa 3D's Simple Coloring hints, and is actually
	 a bit faster than Medusa 3D in this implementation.
	<li>So, to find the simplest hint as quickly as possible I recommend using
	 Coloring and GEM together.<ul>
	 <li>Coloring finds those pesky MultiColoring hints; and it's faster to
	  find the basic Simple Coloring hints verses GEM.
	 <li>GEM maximises both the number of hints produced and eliminations per
	  hint, by being a very naughty boy. They're <b>MY</b> juniper berries!
	 <li>The GEM spec recommends doing basic Coloring before GEM, and it also
	  states that the coloring-chart is re-usable, which does not happen in my
	  implementation, because I'm lazy, so there's an opportunity for someone
	  mad enough. The coloring-chart could also be used as a mine-field. sigh.
	</ul>
	<li>Any and all combos of BUGs and Colorings are fast enough in practice.
   </ul>
   <li>Naked Pent and Hidden Pent are both degenerate, which means that every
	hint is the agglomerate of two simpler techniques. In practice this means
	they don't hint, because we execute solving techniques in (approximate)
	increasing order of complexity.
   <li>Mutant Swampfish is degenerate to Finned and Franken Swampfish, so if
	you really want Mutant Swampfish then unwant Finned and Franken Swampfish,
	but be warned that Mutant means slow, and it finds no more Swampfish.
   <li>The same partially applies to Mutant Swordfish and Mutant Jellyfish.
	Mutant searches all Finned and Franken combos with the Mutant-only combos;
	so if you want Mutants then drop Finned and Franken. Be prepared to wait.
   <li>WARNING: Mutant Jellyfish are TOO SLOW (about 20 minutes for top1465).
   <li>I recommend using both Finned and Franken. Bugger the Mutants! sigh.
   <li><b>Aligned Ally</b> (one up from Diagon Ally;-):<ul>
	<li><i>Aligned Pair</i> is fast,
	<li><i>Aligned Triple</i> is fast enough,
	<li><i>Aligned Quad</i> is acceptable,
	<li><i>Aligned Pent</i> is acceptable (I go unhacked),
	<li><i>Aligned Hex</i> is acceptable (I go unhacked),
	<li><i>Aligned Sept</i> is too slow unhacked, and acceptable hacked but
	 then hints very rarely. sigh.
	<li>WARNING: <i>Aligned Oct, Nona and Dec</i> correct are so slow there's
	 an APB out on them from the <i>School of Incontinent Geoalgorithmic Heuristics</i>
	 at the <i>Stanley College of Advanced Masturbation and Ear Wax Removal</i>.
	<li>WARNING: Aligned Dec correct runs for a <b>____ING DAY</b>!!!
	<li>Any suggestion on how to do Aligned Exclusion faster is most welcome.
	<li>I recommend dropping A*E. They're too slow, because they're too rare.
	 If you really must use A*E then upto A6E is acceptably fast.
	</ul>
   <li><b>Whips &amp; Chainers:</b><ul>
	<li>The <b>Chainers</b> are now so fast compared to the A*E debacle that I
	 really don't know why you'd disable them, except maybe Nested* if you're
	 impatient with Shift-F5. I use all Chainers, but not Nested*.
	<li><i>Unary Chain</i> would be better named Unary Chains and Bidirectional
	 Cycles, but that's just too bloody long. Dynamic Chain finds Unary Chains,
	 but not Bidirectional Cycles, which are "pretty rare" anyways.
	<li><i>Nishio Chain</i> is when an assumption has contradictory effects,
	 hence the assumption must be wrong.
	<li><i>Multiple Chain</i> starts from a cell with two <i>or more</i>
	 potential values. If you unwant Multiple then Dynamic takes longer, which
	 is faster overall; but there's no distinction between static and dynamic
	 chaining, so hints are incorrectly rated harder than they really are.
	<li><i>Dynamic Chain</i> removes maybes from the grid to track effects of
	 each assumption, playing "who's your daddy" on Ass. sigh. Dynamic Chain
	 finds Unary Chains (but not Cycles) and Multiple Chains. I use Dynamic.
	<li><i>Dynamic Plus</i> applies the Four Quick Foxes (Locking, NakedPair,
	 HiddenPair, Swampfish) on top of dynamic chains.<br>
	 This only fails to find a hint on expert level puzzles. Normal people can
	 rely on it to always find a hint. It's check box is disabled so you can't
	 disable it, unless you change the code.
	<li><i>Nested Unary</i> always (AFAIK) hints, even on the worlds hardest
	 puzzle (above). "Normal" people will simply never use it, except when they
	 copy paste the above puzzle to prove to themselves that I'm not completely
	 full of s__t. It's impossible to lick your own elbow!
	<li><i>Nested Multiple/Dynamic/Plus Chains</i> aren't ever used in anger.
	 They exist solely for the amusement of afficionados. You can see them with
	 Shift-F5; just be patient.
	<li>I normally run with Nested Unary/Multiple/Dynamic disabled, but
	 <i>Nested Plus</i> is always enabled, as the ultimate catch-all.
	</ul>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>
I should also mention the <b>LogicalSolverTester</b>, which solves a MagicTour
(.mt) file containing multiple (upto 9999) puzzles, just to see how quickly we
can do it; and verbose logging shows all the hints used to solve each puzzle,
which is how I find puzzles for my test-cases.
<p>
My "standard" test data file is top1465.d5.mt. It contains 1465 Sudoku puzzles
in "approximate" order of hardest to easiest. I need a variety of puzzles to
exercise my hinters, and a "standard" for comparative performance testing:<ul>
 <li>All timings are on an ~2900 Mhz intel i7 notebook solving top1465.d5.mt.
 <li>As a baseline, the original Juillerat implementation took 22 minutes.
 <li>In accuracy (default) mode, with all hinters enabled (all A*E hacked)
  mine took 37 minutes. So SE has a bit of an exclusion problem! sigh.
 <li>so I <b>disable</b> all but "the original" hinters and it takes 1:33 which
  is "fast enough" in my humble opinion. Anything under 5 minutes feels "nice"
  in the GUI. Under 10 minutes feels "pretty snappy". Under 20 minutes would be
  "acceptable"; beyond that it feels like someone stole your lunch.
</ul>
<p>
Try <b>RecursiveSolverTester</b> for speed. It's Knuth's recursive algorithm
+ Four Quick Foxes + Cell.set(AUTOSOLVE) = top1465.d5.mt in 916 ms;
which is FTL, IMHO. All I did was tweak it. Note that this is (I presume) not
repeatable in the current version, because Cell.set is now "non-aggressive".
<p>
I should also mention the test-cases. There are test-cases. No guarantees on
quality. They're minimal and optimistic. Less code equals more speed.
