<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>
<b>Sudoku Explainer</b> (SE) tries to cater for everyone who's interested in
Sudoku puzzles, from wee gromets up to Western European university professors,
but my focus is on hard (ie beyond a humans ability to solve) puzzles.
<p>
<b>Sudoku Explainer</b> shows you how to solve any Sudoku puzzle step by step,
explaining each solving technique as it's applied. It also allows you to get
<b><i>all</i></b> the hints (ie solving techniques) that can be applied to a
puzzle, and to apply any or all of them (singularly or multiply).
<p>
The Sudoku Solving Techniques herein have been described as "old school".
That's fine with me.
I've added techniques from HoDoKu, Sukaku/SudokuMonster, and sudopedia.org in
order to mitigate this valid criticism.
These techniques are NOT faster, they're just (arguably) simpler.
My initial focus was TOO performance-centric.
The downside is that some of the slower techs are unwanted, by default, so
they're there if you're interested, but not slowing you down if you're not.
<p>
<b>Sudoku Explainer</b> analyses The Worlds Hardest Sudoku Puzzle according to
conceptis.com in 27 minutes with everything enabled (and unhacked) on my i7, but
with my preferred solving techniques "wanted" it takes just 4.3 seconds, which
is only 373 times faster, so slow Techs hurt.
<p>
This is how Sudoku Explainer ships, with my current settings file.
<p>
Select everything except:<ul>
<li>All Jellyfish are slow, and the buggers sting.
<li>HiddenQuad is poor value.
<li>Penties are degenerates.
<li>Sue your own DeCoq, mines busy doing push-ups in the long grass.
<li>The complex fish: Franken, Mutant and Kraken (nuts!) are ALL over-rated.
<li>SE has a truly awful wheel Alignment problem, taking ages to resolve.
<li>And finally Nishio is a bit wiffio.
<li>Explanations (such as they are) are in the Selecting Solving Techniques
 section (below).
<li>Repeating: This is how SE ships, with my current settings file.
</ul>
<pre>
THE hardest Sudoku puzzle (conceptis.com)

8..........36......7..9.2...5...7.......457.....1...3...1....68..85...1..9....4..

copy this puzzle (select it with the mouse and press Ctrl-C)
and then paste it (click on the grid and press Ctrl-V
                   or Edit menu ~ Paste grid)
then press F9 (or Tools menu ~ Analyse) to analyse it,
just too see for yourself that SE solves ANY Sudoku puzzle.
</pre>
<p>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>
If you want help with a puzzle then first you need to punch-it-in to SE. Either
left-click on the grey digit (the maybe) to set the cells value, or using the
keyboard: navigate to the-cell-to-be-set with the arrow-keys and then press the
digit key: 1..9 (Ctrl-1..9 cycles a maybe).
<p>
Spacebar, delete, backspace, or 0 (zero) all clear the current cell value. If
you stuff-up then Ctrl-Z (undo) goes back one step at a time. Ctrl-Y to redo.
<p>
When you've got your whole puzzle punched-in press Ctrl-S to save. Now's a good
time to double-check that the puzzle is correct, before you start solving a
typo. A reload could be handy later, so don't forget to save. Ctrl-S now.
<p>
Press F7 to validate: ie check that this puzzle has one and only one solution.
I've seen insufficient clues in published Sudoku's; just some moron rushing to
meet a publication deadline, armed with zero comprehension of Sudoku, algebra,
logic, the force, and/or the ability to workout how to tie ones own shoelaces.
<p>
If you hold down the left-mouse-button over the row labels it highlights all
occurrences of that number, making patterns a bit easier to see. Drag the row
label into the grid to retain highlights whilst doing other mousy stuff.
<p>
If you get stuck press F5 for a hint. To apply that hint and get the next one
just press enter. The enter key only works reliably (one tries and sometimes
fails) when the hintsTree (top right) is selected. Did I mention that GUIs just
s__t me?
<p>
Anyway, that's probably enough to get you started. Have fun with it. Come back
and read the advanced stuff when you get bored.
<p>
<h2>Advanced Stuff</h2>
<p>
More "advanced" Sudokuists will want to remove maybes, as in cell "may be" this
value. Maybes are also commonly called potential values, or candidates. No
matter what you call them, they're displayed as small grey digits in the "empty"
cells. An empty cell is a cell whose value is yet to be determined. If you don't
see any small grey digits goto the Options menu and select "Show&nbsp;maybes".
<p>
To remove a maybe right click on the small grey digit; or using the keyboard:
select the cell with the arrow keys and then Ctrl-digit. Do the same to restore
a maybe; right-click where it should be. You can't restore an invalid one.
<p>
You'll notice that <b>Sudoku Explainer</b> enforces the basic rule of Sudoku:
<i>"There will be one-and-only-one instance of each value in each region"</i>.
So when you punch a 7 into a cell then all the 7's disappear from the maybes of
other cells in the box (the 3x3 block), row (horizontal), and col (vertical),
and no matter what you do you can't get them back, until you zap that 7, when
they all reappear magically.
<p>
To zap the 7 click on the cell and press the 0 key, or delete, or the space bar.
<p>
Sudoku puzzle books are all a bit soft (it's an expert scale) so just seeing the
maybes could get you unstuck; but if not then press F5 to find a hint. Then you
can just press enter to apply that hint and get next, and next... Solvered!
<p>
FYI, my mom does Sudokus. Occasionally she get's stuck. I punch it in and step
through the solution, and then mark-up her Sudoku book with any hints which are
harder than HiddenPair. That's usually enough to get her going again. She has no
idea how much harder Sudokus can get than the published garbage (nothing above
medium, ergo you're still on your P's in the expert world).
<p>
<h3>Buttons</h3>
The following "frequently used" <b>buttons</b> are arranged along the bottom
of the form (I never use the buttons, or the menus. I hope they still work):
<ul>
 <li><b>Clear hints</b> clears the hints tree and refreshes the Sudoku grid.
 <li><b>Solve step</b> applies the selected hint (if any) and gets the next
  (simplest possible) step in solving the puzzle. Click the [Solve step] button
  again to apply the selected hint, and get the next one; or just double-click
  on the hint in the hints tree, or click in the hintsTree (to select it) and
  press enter. That's how to watch a Sudoku puzzle being solved: <b>Just Keep
  Pressing Enter!</b> which takes all the fun out of it really, except that SE
  solves ANY Sudoku puzzle, even really <i>really</i> <i><b>really</b></i> hard
  ones (like conceptis's above). My challenge is to solve all possible Sudoku
  puzzles as simply and quickly as possible, and provide a step-by-step
  explanation of that solution, just because it was there (Hillary E.),
  all whilst not taking ones self too seriously (Adams D.). Just be glad I'm not
  (currently) disennotenating your PH.
 <li><b>Get next hint</b> to get hints again without applying the current one.
  Why would you do that? Because there's a button for it, obviously!
 <li><b>Apply hint</b> to apply the current hint, without getting the next one.
  You can select multiple hints in the HintsTree and apply them all with this
  button; or Just Press Enter! Dunno why you'd actually do that, but it is
  possible, because there's a button for it, which is nice really, isn't it?
 <li><b>Get all hints</b> which can be applied to the current grid. Hold down
  the shift key to get even more hints, but be forewarned, this can take a
  minute (or three) on my i7 UNLESS you sort-out your wanted bloody Techs!
  There's more on this later. More on. Get it? Sigh. My bad. Soz.
</ul>
<p>
<h3>Controls worth a blurb</h3><ul>
 <li><b>The HintsTree</b> is grouped by category &amp; hinter, in decreasing
  eliminations or increasing difficulty, depending on your "Filter Hints"
  setting. Expand each category by clicking on it. Double click on a hint to
  apply it and find the next hint, or single-click and press Enter. If you just
  press Enter with no hint selected it selects the first hint, applies it, and
  then finds the next hint.
 <li><b>Filter Hints</b> Be warned that Shft-F5 (Find MORE hints) may produce
  20,000+ hints when Filter hints is unselected, which "bogs" the GUI.<ul>
  <li>The Filter hints routine checks "does this hint do anything new", so when
  all of a more complex hints actions (cells set and maybes eliminated) are
  already covered by simpler hints/hinters then the more complex hint gets
  suppressed, reducing hints, so that the ____ing GUI doesn't bog-down. Have I
  mentioned that GUIs just ___ me?
  <li>Filter hints also effects the order in which hints are displayed:<ul>
   <li>when <b>on</b>: it's most-effective (max elims) then simplest first, but
   <li>when <b>off</b> hints are not sorted, so they're displayed in the order
    that they were found, meaning (more-or-less) by complexity. <br>
	But Shft-F5 can bog the GUI. Just be patient. Horses for courses.
  </ul>
  <li>Filter hints also switches on/off the Siamese Locking search:<ul>
   <li>When Filter hints is <b>on</b> the Locking hinter (Pointing and Claiming)
    looks for "siamese" locking and uses the HiddenPair/Triple hinters to locate
    <u>all</u> possible eliminations, and if they're more it "upgrades" the hint,
	which is all very nice; but
   <li>It's a bit slow Redge (It's under the bonnet son), so this "nice to have"
	feature is disabled when you switch-<b>off</b> Filter hints.
  </ul>
  <li>Filter Hints also used-to defeat the turbo, but that's history.
  <li>A large Aligned*Exclusion hint takes upto like 10 seconds to DOM-parse
   because of profligate use of color tags. A GUI programmer with HTML/styles
   could help here. I would not have a clue what a style is. I don't have any.
  <li>Did I mention that I ____ing hate GUI's? Can you imagine why? If it were
   up to me the whole world would be in text...
   <pre><tt>The Full Matrix: In cinemas next Tuesday.</tt></pre>
 </ul>
</ul>
<p>
<h3>Menu stuff worth a mention</h3><ul>
 <li><b>File menu ~ load next Puzzle</b> or just Ctrl-P loads the next puzzle.
  The meaning of "next" depends on what you've got open. The <i>.mt</i> files
  (magic-tour) are a multi-puzzle format, but next on a <i>.txt</i> file opens
  the next text-file in the current directory. <b>NOTE</b> that when you open
  the next puzzle SE analyses the puzzle automatically, which may take a while,
  depending on the difficulty of the puzzle and which Solving Techniques you've
  got enabled (some are MUCH slower than others).
 <li><b>File menu ~ Generate</b> to generate new Sudoku puzzles. I warn you that
  SE's generator is a joke to the boffins, but it's good enough for simpler
  puzzles, that might even be solvable by normal people. Generating hard Sudokus
  is one of those problems that's only available to pepes who find combinatorial
  mathematics so easy they qualify as astro-pysicists instead, then wind-up
  analysing DNA, coz it's REALLY ____ing interesting. Pun intended. Go Cleetus?
 <li><b>File menu ~ Recent Files</b> (Ctrl-M) to go back in time.
 <li><b>File menu ~ Reload</b> (Alt-F R, or just Ctrl-R) reloads the currently
  loaded puzzle from disk, which I find handy, to back the truck right up.
 <li><b>File menu ~ log View</b> for techies: view hints of a type in the .log
  of a previous LogicalSolverTester run, to re/exercise the hinter/s and/or see
  how hinttype/s look in GUI.
 <li><b>Tools menu ~ Reset Potential Values</b> restores the puzzles maybes,
  which is handy if you bugger-it-all-up and want to restore the puzzle to a
  valid state before trying again. Note that reset doesn't remove cell values,
  even if they're wrong. Use Ctrl-Z or Reload for that.
 <li><b>F6 - Get a clue</b> points you towards the next step. Shift-F6 gives
  you a bit more information (it's basically the hint for simpler techniques).
  For harder techniques a clue is the help I think I should want when solving
  a Sudoku manually because it tells me which technique to apply next, allowing
  me to skip all the inapplicable techniques; but what I actually use is the
  hints, but I'm a programmer, so for me the challenge is writing the code to
  produce the hints to solve all Sudoku puzzles, not solving A puzzle, as I
  presume it is for most people. Clues are there if you want them.
 <li><b>F7 - Check validity</b> checks that there are no doubled values; that
  each empty cell has at least 1 potential value; that all regions have a
  possible location for each unplaced value; and finally that the Sudoku has a
  unique (one and only one) solution. This is pretty handy. I'm not really
  surprised (just disgusted) at the prevalence of blatant basic invalidities
  (like 16 clues) in published Sudokus, because idiots are always in a hurry.
  Quality takes time. Get over it.
 <li><b>F9 - Analyse</b> tells you how hard the puzzle is, and summarises the
  steps used to solve it. Note that this is far from the only possible solution
  to the puzzle, it's just <b>a</b> (not THE) simplest recipe using the enabled
  Solving Techniques. There may be other shorter recipes that don't increase the
  difficulty. I'm not seeking the shortest simplest path, just the simplest;
  because that's simpler. <i>A*</i>ing chumpy edges scares me. I don't have the
  reddies for a super-computer.
</ul>
<p>
<h3>Selecting Solving Techniques</h3><ul>
 <li><b>Options ~ Solving techniques...</b> allows you to select which Sudoku
  solving techniques are used to find hints, and in F9 Analyse, and the batch
  (see below):<ul>
   <li>Naked and Hidden Singles are mandatory, so there CheckBoxes are checked
	and disabled. It just makes eff-all sense trying to solve Sudokus without
	singles, so they're both mandatory.
   <li><i>Direct*</i> are useless, but which I mean when unwanted ALL hints are
	still found by there non-direct equivalents. Direct just runs the same
	algorithm twice on each pass, to show hintier ones sooner, which is really
	just a waste of time, unless it isn't because that's what you want. <br>
	Note: Direct* hinters are NEVER used in the batch, even when wanted in GUI.
   <li>Choosing Coloring, XColoring, Medusa3D, and/or GEM (Graded Equivalence
	Marks) is a bit complicated, so here's a break down:<ul>
	<li>BUG (Bivalue Universal Grave) is history. It has been removed. He was
	 too slow.
	<li>Coloring does basic SimpleColoring and the ONLY MultiColoring.
	 SimpleColoring uses 2 coloring sets; and
	 MultiColoring uses 3-or-more coloring sets.
	 If Coloring is unwanted then multiple color-sets are found by Unary Chainer.
	 MultiColoring (3+) are NOT sought by any of XColoring, Medusa3D, or GEM.
	 Coloring does the ONLY MultiColoring, so I always use it.
	<li>XColoring (Extended Coloring) finds more Simple Coloring hints, some of
	 which GEM misses, by design, so I always use it. XColoring, being a bit
	 more complex, is a bit slower than Coloring. Meh!
	<li>DROP Medusa3D. It finds a subset of GEM hints and will produce less
	 elims in the same grid, which then prevents GEM finding the hint, hence
	 Medusa3D is actually counter-productive when used with GEM. Medusa3D is
	 SimpleColoring with extra rules on top of XColoring, to find more elims,
	 but still not quite as many as GEM. Don't use it!
	<li>GEM (Graded Equivalence Marks) is the "ultimate" in SimpleColoring.
	 It finds a superset of Medusa3D's hints. It's a bit faster than Medusa3D in
	 this implementation, but is MUCH MUCH faster on a ns/elim basis because it
	 finds MANY MANY more cells to set.
	<li>So to find the simplest hint as quickly as possible I use Coloring,
	  XColoring, and GEM together:<ul>
	 <li>Coloring does the ONLY MultiColoring.
	 <li>XColoring finds a few that GEM (by design) misses.
	 <li><b>DROP</b> Medusa3D coz it impinges some GEM hints.
	 <li>GEM for the ultimate SimpleColoring.
	 <li>Note that GEM should find all SimpleColoring, but Coloring finds the
	  basic ones faster, and counter-intuitively GEM's performance actually
	  improves when you present it with a grid that contains no basic coloring
	  problems. An observation for which I'm too dumb to see an explanation.
	 <li>Any combinations of Coloring/s is fast enough in practice.
	</ul>
	<li>Opportunities for GEM-provement (now THAT'S a dad joke!):<ul>
	 <li>The GEM spec says the color-chart is re-usable; which I have not
	  implemented, coz I'm lazy, so there's an opportunity.
	 <li>A public color-chart could also be used as a trip-wire-network: if any
	  fully colored cell-value is set subsequently then all cell-values and ons
	  of that color could also be set, which I haven't, coz I'm lazy/stupid.
	 </ul>
   </ul>
   <li>Naked Pent and Hidden Pent are both degenerate, which means that every
	hint is the agglomerate of two simpler techniques. In practice this means
	they don't hint, because we execute solving techniques in (approximate)
	increasing order of complexity.
   <li>The Fish Saga (by I.P. Knightly; illustrated by Betty Wont): <ul>
	<li>Finned Jellyfish are just a tad slow, so I usually drop them, but you
	 can use them if you're more patient than I am. Most people are. Sigh. In
	 fact <u>ALL</u> Jellyfish are a bit slow, so I drop them.
	<li>Mutant Swampfish is degenerate to Finned and Franken Swampfish, so if
	 you really want Mutant Swampfish then unwant Finned and Franken Swampfish,
	 but be warned that Mutant means slow, and it finds no more Swampfish; so I
	 never use Mutant anything, nor Krakens, for basically the same reason.
	<li>The same partially applies to Mutant Swordfish and Mutant Jellyfish.
	 Mutant searches all Finned and Franken combos with the Mutant-only combos.
	<li>Krakens are ____ing mental! Adjuncting Chaining to Fish and pretending
	 that the resulting abortion is simpler than Chaining is an oxymoron. It
	 simply cannot be true, therefore Krakens should not exist, but they do, so
	 they're there, so you can use them if you like, but I don't, because EVERY
	 Kraken hint can be found faster by a Chainer, so Krakens are
	 assbackwards-degenerates, AND they're VERY ____ing slow at it. Kill
	 McKraken! Ignore me. I'm just a cranky old carmudgeon, when struck.
	<li>I use Finned Swamp and Sword (Jellies are all too slow).
	<li>if you want Frankens then drop Finneds, but be patient.
	<li>if you want Mutants then drop Finneds and Frankens, but be more patient.
	<li>Bugger the Kraken! He always was an idiot.
	<li><b>WARNING:</b> Kraken Jellyfish are FAR TOO SLOW (top1465 9 minutes).
	<li><b>WARNING:</b> Mutant Jellyfish are FAR TOO SLOW (top1465 20 minutes).
   </ul>
   <li><b>Aligned Ally</b> (one up from Diagon Ally;-) is slow. That is: I have,
	as yet, been unable to make the big ones fast-enough:<ul>
	<li><i>Aligned Pair</i> is fast enough, but finds no hints in top1465, when
	 using my preferred hinters.
	<li><i>Aligned Triple</i> is fast enough, but scarce,
	<li><i>Aligned Quad</i> is acceptable, but scarce,
	<li><i>Aligned Pent</i> is (barely) acceptable correct, but scarce,
	<li><i>Aligned Hex</i> is border-line correct, but go correct if at all,
	<li><i>Aligned Sept</i> is too slow correct, so use the hacked version
	 if-at-all, which hints very rarely, so don't bother. sigh.
	<li><b>WARNING:</b> Aligned Oct, Nona and Dec correct are so slow there's an
	 APB out on them from the <i>School of Incontinent Geoalgorithmic Heuristics</i>
	 at the <i>Stanley College of Advanced Manual Masturbation and Earwax Removal</i>
	 so if you use these and you don't want to wait all day then use the bloody
	 hacked version, if-at-all. Sigh.
	<li><b>WARNING:</b> Aligned Dec correct runs for ever (like about a day) all
	 by itself, so don't use it, at all, ever. Even the hacked version takes
	 ages. A10E is too slow to be allowed. Don't use it: EVER! Sigh.
	<li>Any suggestion on how to do Aligned Exclusion faster is most welcome.
	<li>I recommend dropping A*E. They're all slow, because they're rare. If
	 you must use A*E then A2..6E are fast enough. A7+E hacked, if at all. A10E
	 just needs shootin.
	</ul>
   <li>Dynamic Plus is a mostly-catch-all. It only misses on expert puzzles.
	Nested Unary is slower, but it ALWAYS hints, so use them both as catch-alls.
   <li>Drop the remainder of Nested*. They're never executed unless you Shft-F5,
	to get MORE hints, in which case they're both "fast enough". Patience. But
	if you're impatient and you're NOT an expert then drop Nested Unary. If a
	puzzle fails to solve then the GUI just says it failed to solve, which to me
	means panic-stations (I broke it), but to you just means that your preferred
	software vendor is a moron, which he is, so that worked-out rather nicely.
   <li><b>Whips &amp; Chainers:</b><ul>
	<li>The <b>Chainers</b> are now so fast compared to the A*E debacle that I
	 really don't know why you'd disable them, except maybe Nested* if you're
	 NOT into expert puzzles and you're impatient with Shift-F5. I use all the
	 basic Chainers, and sometimes disable Nested*, coz I'm too impatient.
	<li><i>Unary Chain</i> would be better named Bidirectional Cycles and Unary
	 Chains, but that's just too bloody long. Dynamic Chain finds Unary Chains,
	 but not Bidirectional Cycles which are "fairly rare" with my preferred
	 hinters (Coloring) anyways, so no never you mind Uncle Arthur.
	<li><i>Nishio Chain</i> is when an assumption has contradictory effects,
	 hence the assumption must be wrong.<ul>
	 <li>Some time ago Nishio performance degraded markedly, and I know not why,
	  so here's an opportunity. I blame the JIT compiler: a poor excuse. I have,
	  as yet, been unable to determine that the problem is in order to fix it.
	  It also manifests that Nicholas Juillerat, whom I have torn large strips
	  off, is extremely competant at the part of the problem that really engages
	  him: chaining. Myself, not so much. I broke it making it faster, so now it
	  isn't. Twas ever thus. Sigh. But atleast I'm up-front about it.
	 </ul>
	<li><i>Multiple Chain</i> starts from a cell with two <i>or more</i> maybes,
	 or a region with more than two places. If you unwant Multiple then Dynamic
	 takes longer, which is faster overall; but there's no distinction between
	 static and dynamic, so hints are reported as harder than they actually are.
	<li><i>Dynamic Chain</i> removes maybes from the grid to track each effects
	 of each assumption, playing "who's your daddy" with Ass's. Dynamic Chain
	 finds Unary Chains (but not Cycles) and Multiple Chains. Use it!
	<li><i>Dynamic Plus</i> applies the Four Quick Foxes (Locking, NakedPair,
	 HiddenPair, and Swampfish) on top of dynamic chains. It only misses on
	 expert puzzles. It always hints on "normal" puzzles (for normal people).
	<li>NOTE: When Generator is set to IDKFA it accepts "harder" Dynamic Chains
	 in place of Dynamic Plus, coz they're really rare, and you probably don't
	 want to wait all day for one to be randomly generated, so I tap-out early.
	 My bad! Soz. But you can fix it (relatively easily) if you care; where-as
	 most folks can't, if the situation was reversed. Occasionally IDKFA still
	 fails to generate, even given 16K opportunities. Maybe 32K might be better?
	 Except we're already waiting half the day (ergo about 5 minutes, which is
	 already a long durry break). I have back-up IDFKA's to replenish the
	 PuzzleCache.
	<li><i>Nested Unary</i> always hints, AFAIK, even on "The Worlds Hardest
	 Sudoku Puzzle" (above). Normal people will never use it, except when they
	 copy-paste the above puzzle to test the theory that I'm completely full of
	 s__t. It's impossible to lick your own elbow!
	<li>NOTE: SE has only ever generated ONE puzzle requiring Nested Unary. They
	 are quite a bit rarer than rockin' horse s__t, and much firmer.
	<li>I usually run with Nested Multiple/Dynamic/Plus disabled. They're never
	 used in anger. They exist solely for the amusement of afficionados. You can
	 see them with Shift-F5; just be patient. There retardation of Shft-F5 is
	 the sole cause of there untimely demise. And good riddance! Sigh.
	</ul>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>
<h2>Extranious S__t</h2><ul>
<li><b>Cheats</b> I should mention the GUI's cheats. The GUI has some cheats,
 but they're ____all use. Just use the hints. I wrote the cheats just to write
 some obfuscated code, because s__t wasn't complicated enough already, so I
 complicated it some more, and then decomplicated it, because I can't ever make
 up my mind about anything, because made-up minds s__t me. Learn. Grow. Adapt.
<li><b>LogicalSolverTester</b> If you want an itemised solution then run the
 LogicalSolverTester (aka the batch) over the puzzle and look at the log file.
 That's why I haven't bothered with it in the GUI. I figure most users don't
 want it, and those that do also want a batch. LST solves a MagicTour (.mt) file
 containing many (upto 9999) puzzles, just to see how quickly we can do it; and
 has verbose logging to show all the hints used to solve each puzzle, which is
 how I find test-case puzzles. You can also now Shft-F9 for verbose analyse
 (in the GUI log-file) or even Alt-F9 for super-verbose (individual hinters).
<li>The GUI has a "Log View" option in the File menu. It retrieves the grid that
 produced the hint (by Java regular expression) to display the hint in the GUI,
 to view hints by type when you're working on a hinter, and especially on the
 display of hints in the GUI.
<li><b>top1465</b> My "standard" test data file is top1465.d5.mt. It contains
 1465 Sudoku puzzles in "approximate" order of hardest to easiest. I need a
 variety of puzzles to exercise my hinters, and a "standard" for comparative
 performance testing:<ul>
 <li>All timings are on an ~2900 Mhz intel i7 notebook solving top1465.d5.mt.
 <li>As a baseline, the original Juillerat implementation took 22 minutes.
 <li>In accuracy (default) mode, with all hinters enabled (all A*E hacked) SE
  took 37 minutes. So SE has a wheel alignment problem! BIG Sigh.
 <li>With my preferred hinters, my current (2021-12-31) "par" is 1:22, at whence
  the whole GUI feels nice and snappy, but anything under 4:00 feels OK. I guess
  even 20:00 might be acceptable, just occasionally gluey.
 <li><b>diuf.sudoku.BuildTimings</b> contains the hinters-summary of previous
  batch .logs, to see if we're progressing through time. Ask a physicist.
 </ul>
<li><b>RecursiveSolverTester</b> is fast. It's Knuth's recursive algorithm plus
 Four Quick Foxes plus Cell.set(AUTOSOLVE=true) equals top1465 in 916 ms; which
 is paramount to FTL-travel, IMHO; hence IDKFA rates an FTL licence. All we did
 was tune-it-up a bit. This is (I presume) not repeatable in released codebase,
 because Cell.set is now "non-aggressive". The "aggressive version" is available
 to techies only, just don't forget to put it back coz it reports elims badly.
<li><b>Test-cases</b> I should also mention test-cases. There are test-cases.
 No guarantees on quality. Minimal and optimistic. Less code equals more speed.
 My bug-bear with test-cases is that they're commonly harder to change than the
 code, so automated-test-cases are only for people-who-make-up-there-minds,
 there-after refusing to learn/adapt, denying the necessity of doing so. Simple
 is good.
