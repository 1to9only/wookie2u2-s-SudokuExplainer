  <h2>Welcome</h2>
  <p>
  <b>Sudoku Explainer</b> tries to cater for everyone who's interested in Sudoku
  puzzles, from gromets up to Western European university professors, but the
  focus is on hard (ie beyond a humans ability to solve) puzzles. The Solving
  Techniques herein have been described as "old school". That's fine with me.
  <p>
  If you're having trouble reading this then right-click in this hint details
  area to copy the HTML to the clipboard, paste it into temp.html and open it
  in your browser, which will allow you to enlarge the font. The hints TreeView
  (upper right) also has this right-click to copy feature. If the GUI fonts are
  too small for you then all I can offer is Windows magnifying glass, it's in
  accessibility settings. Sorry I can't be more help. GUI's just s__t me.
  <p>
  <b>Sudoku Explainer</b> shows you how to solve any Sudoku puzzle step by step,
  explaining each solving technique as it's applied. It also allows you to get
  <b><i>all</i></b> the hints (ie solving techniques) that can be applied to a
  puzzle, and to apply any of them (singularly or multiply).
  <p>
  <b>Sudoku Explainer</b> solves "the worlds hardest Sudoku puzzle" according to
  conceptis.com in 125.610 seconds with all A*E's enabled and unhacked on my i7
  (see the Solving techniques section below for my config preferences):
  <pre>
  8..........36......7..9.2...5...7.......457.....1...3...1....68..85...1..9....4..
  (copy-and-paste this puzzle (Edit menu ~ Paste grid) then press F9 to analyse).
  </pre>
  If you just want a bit of help with a puzzle then the first step is punching
  it in. Either left-click on the small grey digit (the maybe) so set the cells
  value, or with the keyboard: navigate to cell-to-set with the arrow-keys and
  then press the value key (1..9).
  <p>
  If you stuff-up then Ctrl-Z goes back one step at a time. Spacebar, delete,
  backspace, or 0 (zero) all clear the selected cells value. Ctrl-Y does a redo.
  <p>
  When you've got your whole puzzle punched-in do NOT forget to Ctrl-S for save
  BEFORE you start solving it. A reload might be handy. I always forget to save.
  Sigh.
  <p>
  If you get stuck press F5 for a hint. To apply that hint and get the next one
  just press enter.
  <p>
  Anyway, that's probably enough to get you started. Have fun with it. Come back
  and read the advanced stuff when you get bored.
  <p>
  <h2>Advanced Stuff</h2>
  <p>
  More "advanced" users will want to remove maybes (the cells potential values).
  That's those small grey digits in the empty cells. To do that just right-click
  on the small grey digit. With the keyboard: select the cell with the arrow 
  keys and then Ctrl-digit to remove/restore the maybe. You can't restore an
  illegal maybe.
  <p>
  You'll notice that <b>Sudoku Explainer</b> enforces the basic rule of Sudoku:
  <i>"There will be one-and-only-one instance of each value in each region"</i>.
  So when you punch a 7 into a cell then all the 7's disappear from the other
  cells in it's box (the 3x3 thingummy), row, and col (column).
  <p>
  Sudoku puzzle books are all a bit soft (on an expert scale) so just seeing
  the maybes could get you unstuck; but if not then press F5 to find a hint.
  Then you can just press enter to apply that hint and get the next one, and
  the next, and the next... Sudoku Solvered! Too Bloody Easy!
  <p>
  The following "frequently used" <b>buttons</b> are arranged along the bottom
  of the form (I never use them. I do hope they still work):
  <ul>
   <li><b>Clear hints</b> clears the hints tree and refreshes the Sudoku grid.
   <li><b>Solve step</b> applies the selected hint (if any) and gets the next
    (simplest possible) step in solving the puzzle. Click the [Solve step]
    button again to apply the selected hint, and get the next one; or just
    double-click on the hint in the hints tree, or click in the hintsTree (to
    select it) and press enter. That's how to watch the Sudoku puzzle being 
    solved: Just Keep Pressing Enter! which takes all the fun out of it really.
    Sigh. Except that this program can solve any Sudoku puzzle, even really
    really <i>really</i> <i><b>really</b></i> hard ones (like conceptis's),
    and it's a bit of a challenge to solve all possible Sudoku puzzles, 
    especially if you want to do it faster than everybody-else.
   <li><b>Get next hint</b> to get hints again without applying the current one.
    Why would you do that? Because there's a button for it, obviously!<br>
   <li><b>Apply hint</b> to apply the current hint, without getting the next
    one. You can select multiple hints in the HintsTree and apply them all with
    with this button; or Just Press Enter! Dunno why you'd actually do that,
    but it's possible, because there's a button for it, which is nice, isn't it.
   <li><b>Get all hints</b> which can be applied to the current grid. Hold down
    the shift key to get even more hints, but be forewarned, this can take a
    a minute or three on my i7. The HintsTree is grouped by category &amp;
    hinter, in increasing order of difficulty. You'll need to expand each
    category by clicking on it. Be warned that 20,000+ hints may be produced,
    so the GUI can struggle a bit, especially when the "Filter hints" CheckBox
    is NOT selected. It filters hints using the old "does it remove any NEW
    maybes" trick. So if all of a-more-complex-hints actions (cells set &amp;
    maybes eliminated) are already covered by a simpler hint then the latter is
    suppressed, which keeps the hint-count down, so the GUI doesn't struggle.
   <li>It's also worth noting that the larger Aligned*Exclusion hints can take
    several (maybe 5) seconds to DOM-parse because of profligate color tags.
    A GUI programmer with HTML/styles knowledge could help here. I wouldn't
    have a clue what a style is. I don't have any.
  </ul>
  <p>Some other stuff also worth a mention:
  <ul>
   <li><b>File menu ~ load next Puzzle</b> or just Ctrl-P loads the "next"
    puzzle. The meaning of "next" depends on what you've got open. The <i>.mt</i>
    files (magic-tour) are a multi-puzzle format, but next on a <i>.txt<i> file
    opens the next text-file in the current directory. <b>NOTE</b> that when you
    open the next puzzle Sudoku Explainer analyses the puzzle automatically,
    which may take a while, depending on the difficulty of the puzzle and which
    Solving Techniques you've got enabled.
   <li><b>File menu ~ Reload</b> (Alt-F-R) or just Ctrl-R reloads the saved
    puzzle from disk. I find this really handy. It'll even let you try chaining
    manually, if you're over 90, have a decade to kill, and are <b>SERIOUSLY</b>
    sexually frustrated but find that you no longer have the manual dexte....
    Never mind. Ctrl-R to reload the puzzle. OK?
   <li><b>Tools menu ~ Reset Potential Values</b> restores the maybes in the
    current grid, which is handy if you bugger-it-all-up and want to restore the
    grid to a valid state before trying again. But note that reset PV's doesn't
    remove cell values, even if they're wrong.
   <li><b>F6 - Get a clue</b> points you towards the next step. Shift-F6 gives
    you a bit more information (it's basically the hint for simpler techniques).
    For harder techniques a clue is the help I think I should want when solving
    a Sudoku manually because it tells me which technique to apply next, 
    allowing me to skip all the inapplicable techniques. What I actually use
    is the hints, but I'm a programmer, so for me the challenge is writing the
    code to produce the hints to solve all Sudoku puzzles, not solving A puzzle,
    as I presume it is for most people. Clues are there if you want them.
   <li><b>F7 - Check validity</b> checks that there are no doubled values; that
    each empty cell has at least 1 potential value; that all regions have a
    possible location for each unplaced value; and finally that the Sudoku has
    a unique (one and only one) solution. This is pretty handy. I'm not really
    surprised at the prevalence of blatant (even basic, like 16 clues)
    invalidities in published Sudoku puzzles. Morons in a hurry.
   <li><b>F9 - Analyse</b> tells you how hard the puzzle is, and gives you a
    summary of steps which may be used to solve it. Note that this is far from
    the only recipe which solves the puzzle, it's just <b>a</b> (not THE)
    simplest possible recipe with the enabled Solving Techniques. There may be
    other recipes that are shorter whilst not increasing difficulty. I'm not
    seeking the shortest simplest path, just the simplest; because that's a lot
    simpler. Yeah? A real guru could do better, I'm sure. I'm far too thick to
    even contemplate an <i>A*</i> on edges this slow.
   <li><b>Options ~ Solving techniques...</b> allows you to select which Sudoko
    solving techniques are applicable:
    <ul>
     <li><i>Naked Singles</i>, <i>Hidden Singles</i> and <i>Dynamic Plus</i>
      are mandatory, so there CheckBoxes are checked and disabled. You can't
      disable the singles, because they're fast and effective. Dynamic Plus is
      the catch-all. It only fails to find a hint on "expert" level puzzles.
     <li><i>Direct*</i> is basically useless. When they're unchecked the hints
      are still found by there non-direct equivalents, Direct just runs the 
      same algorithm twice on each pass, which takes a bit longer.
     <li><b>Aligned Ally</b> (that's two up from Diagon Ally):
      <ul>
      <li><i>Aligned Pair</i> is fast,
      <li><i>Aligned Triple</i> is fast enough,
      <li><i>Aligned Quad</i> is acceptable (I go unhacked),
      <li><i>Aligned Pent</i> is acceptable (I go unhacked),
      <li><i>Aligned Hex</i> is acceptable (I go unhacked),
      <li><i>Aligned Sept</i> is slow (I still go unhacked),
      <li><i>Aligned Oct</i> is too slow (I go HACKED here down),
      <li><i>Aligned Nona and Dec</i> are so ____ing slow that there's an APB
       out on them from the <i>School of Algorithmic Incontinence</i> of the
       <i>Walgat College of Agriculture and Advanced Barnacle Polishing</i>.<br>
      <li>WARNING: The "correct" Aligned Dec has been known to take 15 seconds
       to NOT find a bloody hint, so just use the hacked version. A10E's are as
       rare as chickens lips anyways. Any and all suggestions on how to do
       Aligned*Exclusion faster will be gratefully accepted. "City life's made
       him a bit slow, Redge... It's under the bonnet son."
      </ul>
     <li><b>Wips &amp; Chainers:</b>
      <ul>
      <li>The <b>Chainers</b> are now so fast (especially compared to the
       Aligned*Exclusion debacle) that I really don't know why you'd bother
       disabling them, except Nested* if you're impatient with Shift-F5.
       I use all Chainers, but I deselect Nested*, except Nested Plus,
       which is the ultimate catch-all.
      <li><i>Unary Chain</i> would be better named "Unary Chains and
       Bidirectional Cycles" but that's just too bloody long. Dynamic Chain
       finds Unary Chains, but not Bidirectional Cycles, which are "rare".
      <li><i>Nishio Chain</i> is when a single assumption has contradictory
       ramifications (so the assumption must be wrong). I always use them.
      <li><i>Multiple Chain</i> starts from a cell with two <i>or more</i>
       potential values. If you deselect Multiple then Dynamic takes a bit
       longer, which tends to work-out faster overall. Go figure! I always
       use them.
      <li><i>Dynamic Chain</i> removes maybes from the grid to track the
       consequences of it's assumptions: so it can play "who's your daddy"
       with assumptions. Dynamic Chain finds Unary Chains (but not Cycles)
       and Multiple Chains. I allways use them.
      <li><i>Dynamic Plus</i> uses the Four Quick Foxes on top of "standard"
       dynamic chaining. It only fails to find a hint on the worlds hardest
       puzzles. Normal people can rely on it to ALWAYS find a hint. It's check
       box is disabled so you can't disable it (unless you hack the registry).
      <li><i>Nested Unary</i> is only ever used in anger to analyse the worlds
       hardest puzzles. "Normal" people can disable it with confidence.
      <li><i>Nested Multiple/Dynamic/Plus Chains</i> aren't ever used in
       anger. They exist solely for the amusement of us afficionados. If you're
       interested you can see them with Shift-F5, but be patient. I normally
       run with Nested Unary/Multiple/Dynamic disabled. But I always leave
       <i>Nested Plus</i> selected as the ultimate catch-all.
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </ul>
 <p>
 I should also mention the <b>LogicalSolverTester</b>, which solves a MagicTour
 (.mt) file containing multiple (upto 9999) puzzles, just to see how quickly we
 can do it, and optionally (with Log.MODE=VERBOSE_5_MODE) what hints apply to
 each puzzle, which is how I find test-case puzzles.
 <ul>
  <li>All timings are on an ~2900 Mhz intel i7 notebook solving top1465.d5.mt.
  <li>As a baseline, the original Juillerat implementation took 22 minutes.
  <li>In accuracy (default) mode, with all hinters enabled mine took 58 minutes.
  <li>So Sudoku Explainer has a bit of an exclusion alignment problem: so we
   <b>disable</b> Direct*, Hidden Quad, Naked Pent, Hidden Pent, and A4+E; to
   bring it back to "the original hinters" and it takes 1:33, which is "fast
   enough", IMHO.
 </ul>
 <p>
 Try the <b>RecursiveSolverTester</b> if what you're really after is solving
 Sudoku puzzles quickly. It's Knuth's (IIRC) recursive algorithm, plus the Four
 Quick Foxes, plus my Cell.set(AUTOSOLVE). It did top1465.d5.mt in about a
 second, which is tantamount to FTL, IMHO. All I did was tune it up a bit.
