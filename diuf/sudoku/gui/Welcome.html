<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>
<b>Sudoku Explainer</b> (SE) tries to cater for everyone who's interested in
Sudoku puzzles, from wee gromets up to Western European university professors,
but my focus is on hard (ie beyond a humans ability to solve) puzzles.
<p>
<b>Sudoku Explainer</b> shows you how to solve any Sudoku puzzle step by step,
explaining each solving technique as it's applied. It also allows you to get
<b><i>all</i></b> the hints (ie solving techniques) that can be applied to a
puzzle, and to apply any or all of them (singularly or multiply).
<p>
The Sudoku Solving Techniques herein have been described as "old school".
That's fine with me.
I've added techniques from HoDoKu, Sukaku/SudokuMonster, and sudopedia.org in
order to mitigate this valid criticism.
These techniques are NOT faster, they're just (arguably) simpler.
My initial focus was TOO performance-centric.
The downside is that some of the slower techs are unwanted, by default, so
they're there if you're interested, but not slowing you down if you're not.
<p>
<b>Sudoku Explainer</b> analyses "the worlds hardest Sudoku puzzle" (according
to conceptis.com) in 27 minutes with everything enabled (and unhacked) on my i7,
but with my preferred solving techniques selected (see the Solving Techniques
section below) it takes about 6 seconds, which is only 270 times faster, so slow
Tech selection hurts. SE has a wheel alignment problem. Mutants are best left
alone. Damn the Kraken!
<pre>
THE hardest Sudoku puzzle (conceptis.com)

8..........36......7..9.2...5...7.......457.....1...3...1....68..85...1..9....4..

copy this puzzle (select it with the mouse and press Ctrl-C)
and then paste it (click on the grid and press Ctrl-V
                   or Edit menu ~ Paste grid)
then press F9 (or Tools menu ~ Analyse) to analyse it,
just too see for yourself that SE solves ANY Sudoku puzzle.
</pre>
<p>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>
If you want help with a puzzle then first you need to punch-it-in to SE. Either
left-click on the grey digit (the maybe) to set the cells value, or using the
keyboard: navigate to the-cell-to-be-set with the arrow-keys and then press the
digit key: 1..9 (Ctrl-1..9 cycles a maybe).
<p>
Spacebar, delete, backspace, or 0 (zero) all clear the current cell value. If
you stuff-up then Ctrl-Z (undo) goes back one step at a time. Ctrl-Y to redo.
<p>
When you've got your whole puzzle punched-in press Ctrl-S to save. Now's a good
time to double-check that the puzzle is correct, before you start solving a
typo. A reload could be handy later, so don't forget to save. Ctrl-S now.
<p>
Press F7 to validate: ie check that this puzzle has one and only one solution.
I've seen insufficient clues in published Sudoku's; just some moron rushing to
meet a publication deadline, armed with zero understanding of Sudoku, the force,
algebra, and/or the ability to nut-out how to tie ones own shoelaces.
<p>
If you hold down the left-mouse-button over the row labels it highlights all
occurrences of that number, making patterns a bit easier to see. Drag the row
label into the grid to retain highlights whilst doing other mousy stuff.
<p>
If you get stuck press F5 for a hint. To apply that hint and get the next one
just press enter. The enter key only works reliably (one tries and sometimes
fails) when the hintsTree (top right) is selected. Did I mention that GUIs just
s__t me?
<p>
Anyway, that's probably enough to get you started. Have fun with it. Come back
and read the advanced stuff when you get bored.
<p>
<h2>Advanced Stuff</h2>
<p>
More "advanced" Sudokuists will want to remove maybes, aka potential values, or
candidates. That's those small grey digits in the empty cells. If you don't see
any small grey digits goto the Options menu and select "Show maybes".
<p>
To remove a maybe right click on the small grey digit; or using the keyboard:
select the cell with the arrow keys and then Ctrl-digit. Do the same to restore
a maybe; right-click where it should be. You can't restore an invalid one.
<p>
You'll notice that <b>Sudoku Explainer</b> enforces the basic rule of Sudoku:
<i>"There will be one-and-only-one instance of each value in each region"</i>.
So when you punch a 7 into a cell then all the 7's disappear from the maybes of
other cells in the box (the 3x3 block), row (horizontal), and col (vertical),
and no matter what you do you can't get them back, unless you zap that 7.
<p>
To zap the 7 click on the cell and press the 0 key, or delete, or the space bar.
<p>
Sudoku puzzle books are all a bit soft (it's an expert scale) so just seeing the
maybes could get you unstuck; but if not then press F5 to find a hint. Then you
can just press enter to apply that hint and get next, and next... Solvered!
<p>
<h3>Buttons</h3>
The following "frequently used" <b>buttons</b> are arranged along the bottom
of the form (I never use the buttons, or the menus. I hope they still work):
<ul>
 <li><b>Clear hints</b> clears the hints tree and refreshes the Sudoku grid.
 <li><b>Solve step</b> applies the selected hint (if any) and gets the next
  (simplest possible) step in solving the puzzle. Click the [Solve step] button
  again to apply the selected hint, and get the next one; or just double-click
  on the hint in the hints tree, or click in the hintsTree (to select it) and
  press enter. That's how to watch a Sudoku puzzle being solved: Just Keep
  Pressing Enter! which takes all the fun out of it really, except that SE
  solves any Sudoku puzzle, even really <i>really</i> <i><b>really</b></i> hard
  ones (like conceptis's above). My challenge is to solve all <u>possible</u>
  Sudoku puzzles as simply as possible to provide a step-by-step explanation;
  and do it all as quickly as possible; just because Sudoku was there.
 <li><b>Get next hint</b> to get hints again without applying the current one.
  Why would you do that? Because there's a button for it, obviously!<br>
 <li><b>Apply hint</b> to apply the current hint, without getting the next one.
  You can select multiple hints in the HintsTree and apply them all with this
  button; or Just Press Enter! Dunno why you'd actually do that, but it is
  possible, because there's a button for it, which is nice really, isn't it.
 <li><b>Get all hints</b> which can be applied to the current grid. Hold down
  the shift key to get even more hints, but be forewarned, this can take a
  minute (or three) on my i7 UNLESS you've sorted-out your wanted Techs!
</ul>
<p>
<h3>Controls worth a blurb</h3><ul>
 <li><b>The HintsTree</b> is grouped by category &amp; hinter, in decreasing
  eliminations or increasing difficulty, depending on your "Filter Hints"
  setting. Expand each category by clicking on it. Double click on a hint to
  apply it and find the next hint, or single-click and press Enter. If you just
  press Enter with no hint selected it selects the first hint, applies it, and
  then finds the next hint.
 <li><b>Filter Hints</b> Be warned that Shft-F5 (Find MORE hints) may produce
  20,000+ hints when Filter hints is unselected, which "bogs" the GUI.<ul>
  <li>The Filter hints routine checks "does this hint do anything new", so when
  all of a more complex hints actions (cells set and maybes eliminated) are
  already covered by simpler hints then the more complex hint is suppressed,
  reducing hints, so that the ____ing GUI doesn't bog-down.
  <li>Filter hints also effects the order in which hints are displayed:<ul>
   <li>when <b>on</b>: it's most-effective (max eliminations) then simplest first, but
   <li>when <b>off</b> hints are not sorted, so they're displayed in the order
    that they were found, meaning (arbitrarily) least-complex to most-complex. <br>
	But Shft-F5 can bog the GUI. Just be patient. Horses for courses.
  </ul>
  <li>Filter hints also switches on/off the Siamese Locking search:<ul>
   <li>When Filter hints is <b>on</b> the Locking hinter (Pointing and Claiming)
    looks for "siamese" locking and uses the HiddenPair/Triple hinters to locate
    <u>all</u> possible eliminations, and if they're more it "upgrades" the hint,
	which is all very nice; but
   <li>It's a bit slow Redge (It's under the bonnet son), so this "nice" feature
	is switched-off when you switch-<b>off</b> Filter hints.
  </ul>
  <li>For a while Filter Hints also defeated the turbo, but that's history.
  <li>A large Aligned*Exclusion hint takes upto like 10 seconds to DOM-parse
   because of profligate use of color tags. A GUI programmer with HTML/styles
   could help here. I would not have a clue what a style is. I don't have any.
  <li>Did I mention that I ____ing hate GUI's? Can you imagine why? If it were
   up to me the whole world would be in text...

 </ul>
</ul>
<p>
<h3>Menu stuff worth a mention</h3><ul>
 <li><b>File menu ~ load next Puzzle</b> or just Ctrl-P loads the next puzzle.
  The meaning of "next" depends on what you've got open. The <i>.mt</i> files
  (magic-tour) are a multi-puzzle format, but next on a <i>.txt</i> file opens
  the next text-file in the current directory. <b>NOTE</b> that when you open
  the next puzzle SE analyses the puzzle automatically, which may take a while,
  depending on the difficulty of the puzzle and which Solving Techniques you've
  got enabled (some are MUCH slower than others).
 <li><b>File menu ~ Generate</b> to generate new Sudoku puzzles. I warn you that
  my generate is poor compared to the best, but it's good for simpler puzzles.
 <li><b>File menu ~ Recent Files</b> to go back in time.
 <li><b>File menu ~ Reload</b> (Alt-F-R) or just Ctrl-R reloads the saved puzzle
  from disk, which I find handy.
 <li><b>File menu ~ log View</b> for techies: view hints of a type in the .log
  of a previous LogicalSolverTester run, to re/exercise the hinter/s and/or see
  how hinttype/s look in GUI.
 <li><b>Tools menu ~ Reset Potential Values</b> restores the puzzles maybes,
  which is handy if you bugger-it-all-up and want to restore the puzzle to a
  valid state before trying again. Note that reset doesn't remove cell values,
  even if they're wrong. Use Ctrl-Z or Reload for that.
 <li><b>F6 - Get a clue</b> points you towards the next step. Shift-F6 gives
  you a bit more information (it's basically the hint for simpler techniques).
  For harder techniques a clue is the help I think I should want when solving
  a Sudoku manually because it tells me which technique to apply next, allowing
  me to skip all the inapplicable techniques; but what I actually use is the
  hints, but I'm a programmer, so for me the challenge is writing the code to
  produce the hints to solve all Sudoku puzzles, not solving A puzzle, as I
  presume it is for most people. Clues are there if you want them.
 <li><b>F7 - Check validity</b> checks that there are no doubled values; that
  each empty cell has at least 1 potential value; that all regions have a
  possible location for each unplaced value; and finally that the Sudoku has a
  unique (one and only one) solution. This is pretty handy. I'm not really
  surprised (just disgusted) at the prevalence of blatant basic invalidities
  (like 16 clues) in published Sudokus, because idiots are always in a hurry.
  Quality takes time. Get over it.
 <li><b>F9 - Analyse</b> tells you how hard the puzzle is, and summarises the
  steps used to solve it. Note that this is far from the only possible solution
  to the puzzle, it's just <b>a</b> (not THE) simplest recipe using the enabled
  Solving Techniques. There may be other shorter recipes that don't increase the
  difficulty. I'm not seeking the shortest simplest path, just the simplest;
  because that's simpler. Yeah? <i>A*</i>ing chumpy edges scares me.
</ul>
<p>
<h3>Selecting Solving Techniques</h3><ul>
 <li><b>Options ~ Solving techniques...</b> allows you to select which Sudoku
  solving techniques are considered when seeking the next hint, and are also
  used in F9 Analyse:<ul>
   <li>Naked and Hidden Singles are mandatory, so there CheckBoxes are checked
	and disabled. It makes eff-all sense trying to solve Sudokus without them,
	so they're mandatory.
   <li>Dynamic Plus is a bit of a catch-all. It only misses on expert puzzles.
	Nested Unary is slower, but it ALWAYS hints, so I use both as catch-alls,
	that is I always have them both enabled. The remainder of Nested* can go.
	They're never executed unless you Shft-F5, to get MORE hints.
   <li><i>Direct*</i> are useless, but which I mean when unwanted ALL hints are
	still found by there non-direct equivalents. Direct just runs the same
	algorithm twice on each pass, to show hintier ones sooner, which is really
	just a waste of time, unless it isn't because that's what you really want.
   <li>Choosing BUG, Coloring, XColoring, Medusa3D, and/or GEM (Graded Equinox
	Marks) is pretty complicated, so here's the break down:<ul>
	<li>BUG (Bivalue Umbilical Grave) is a Grand-daddy solving technique; which
	 might reasonably now be regarded as "deprecated" because it ambulates with
	 a Zimmer frame, but it still sort-of-works, sometimes, eventually.
	<li>Coloring does Simple (2 sets) and Multi (3+ sets) Coloring . It's faster
     and finds more hints than BUG. It's the ONLY coloring technique searching
	 multiple (3+) color-sets. If Coloring is unwanted then multiple color-set
	 hints are be found by the Unary Chainer, if wanted. Multi-Coloring hints
	 are NOT sought by any of XColoring, Medusa3D, or GEM. Coloring implements
	 the ONLY Multi-Coloring. You should use Coloring!
	<li>XColoring (Extended Coloring) finds more Simple Coloring hints, some of
	 which GEM misses, so I still use it. XColoring, being more complex, is a
	 bit slower than Coloring. So be it.
	<li>Medusa3D finds even more Simple Coloring hints than XColoring, using
	 value-cell sets, but is thereby a bit slower again. Medusa3D finds a subset
	 of GEM hints, and finds less eliminations in the same grid so Medusa3D is
	 counter-productive with GEM.
	<li>GEM (Graded Equivalence Marks) is the "ultimate" in Simple Coloring. It
	 finds a superset of Medusa3D's hints, and is actually a bit faster than
	 Medusa3D in this implementation, but is MUCH faster on a ns/elim basis coz
	 it finds so-many-more cells to set.
	<li>So to find the simplest hint as quickly as possible I recommend using
	 Coloring, XColoring, and GEM together:<ul>
	 <li>Coloring does the ONLY Multi-Coloring.
	 <li>XColoring hits a few that GEM (by design) misses.
	 <li>GEM for ultimate Simple-Coloring.
	 <li>but any combo of BUGs/Colorings are fast enough in practice.
	</ul>
    <li>Opportunities for improvement:<ul>
	 <li>The GEM spec says the color-chart is re-usable; which I have not
	  implemented, coz I'm lazy, so there's an opportunity.
	 <li>A public color-chart could also be used as a trip-wire-network: if any
	  fully colored cell-value is set subsequently then all cell-values and ons
	  of that color could also be set, but I haven't, to keep it simple.
	 </ul>
   </ul>
   <li>Naked Pent and Hidden Pent are both degenerate, which means that every
	hint is the agglomerate of two simpler techniques. In practice this means
	they don't hint, because we execute solving techniques in (approximate)
	increasing order of complexity.
   <li>Finned Jellyfish are just a tad slow, so I usually drop them, but you
	can use them if you're more patient than I am. Most people are. sigh.
   <li>Mutant Swampfish is degenerate to Finned and Franken Swampfish, so if
	you really want Mutant Swampfish then unwant Finned and Franken Swampfish,
	but be warned that Mutant means slow, and it finds no more Swampfish; so I
	never use Mutant anything, nor Krakens, for basically the same reason.<ul>
   <li>The same partially applies to Mutant Swordfish and Mutant Jellyfish.
    Mutant searches all Finned and Franken combos with the Mutant-only combos.
	<li>if you want Mutants then drop Finned and Franken, but be prepared to wait.
    <li>I use Finned and sometimes Franken. Bugger the Mutant and his Kraken!
    <li><b>WARNING:</b> Mutant Jellyfish are FAR TOO SLOW (top1465 20 minutes).
    <li><b>WARNING:</b> Kraken Jellyfish are FAR TOO SLOW (top1465 9 minutes).
   </ul>
   <li><b>Aligned Ally</b> (one up from Diagon Ally;-) is a cluster____ of
	insanity that I have, as yet, been unable implement adequately:<ul>
	<li><i>Aligned Pair</i> is fast enough,
	<li><i>Aligned Triple</i> is fast enough,
	<li><i>Aligned Quad</i> is acceptable,
	<li><i>Aligned Pent</i> is acceptable (I go unhacked),
	<li><i>Aligned Hex</i> is barely acceptable (I go unhacked),
	<li><i>Aligned Sept</i> is too slow unhacked, and acceptable hacked but then
	 hints very rarely. sigh.
	<li><b>WARNING:</b> <i>Aligned Oct, Nona and Dec</i> correct are so slow there's
	 an APB out on them from the <i>School of Incontinent Geoalgorithmic Heuristics</i>
	 at the <i>Stanley College of Advanced Ministerial Masturbation and Earwax Removal</i>.
	<li><b>WARNING:</b> Aligned Dec correct runs for a <b>____ING DAY</b>!
	<li>Any suggestion on how to do Aligned Exclusion faster is most welcome.
	<li>I recommend dropping A*E. They're too slow, because they're too rare.
	 If you must use A*E then A-6E are fast enough. A7+E hacked, if at all.
	</ul>
   <li><b>Whips &amp; Chainers:</b><ul>
	<li>The <b>Chainers</b> are now so fast compared to the A*E debacle that I
	 really don't know why you'd disable them, except maybe Nested* if you never
	 do REALLY hard puzzles and you're impatient with Shift-F5. I always use all
	 the Chainers, but sometimes disable all Nested except Nested Unary.
	<li><i>Unary Chain</i> would be better named Unary Chains and Bidirectional
	 Cycles, but that's just too bloody long. Dynamic Chain finds Unary Chains,
	 but not Bidirectional Cycles, which are "pretty rare" anyways.
	<li><i>Nishio Chain</i> is when an assumption has contradictory effects,
	 hence the assumption must be wrong.<ul>
	 <li>Some time ago Nishio performance degraded markedly, for some reasons
	  that I do not understand, so there's a mystery and an opportunity here.
	  I've just been blaming the bloody JIT compiler. A miserable excuse.
	 </ul>
	<li><i>Multiple Chain</i> starts from a cell with two <i>or more</i> maybes.
	 If you unwant Multiple then Dynamic takes longer, which is faster overall;
	 but there's no distinction between static and dynamic chaining, so hints
	 are incorrectly rated harder than they really are.
	<li><i>Dynamic Chain</i> removes maybes from the grid to track the effects of
	 each assumption, playing "who's your daddy" with Assumptions. sigh. Dynamic
	 Chain finds Unary Chains (but not Cycles) and Multiple Chains. I use Dynamic.
	<li><i>Dynamic Plus</i> applies the Four Quick Foxes (Locking, NakedPair,
	 HiddenPair, Swampfish) on top of dynamic chains.<br>
	 This only fails to find a hint on expert level puzzles. Normal people can
	 rely on it to always find a hint.
	<li><i>Nested Unary</i> always (AFAIK) hints, even on the worlds hardest
	 puzzle (above). "Normal" people will simply never use it, except when they
	 copy-paste the above puzzle to test there theory that I'm completely full
	 of s__t. It's impossible to lick your own elbow!
	<li><i>Nested Multiple/Dynamic/Plus Chains</i> aren't ever used in anger.
	 They exist solely for the amusement of afficionados. You can see them with
	 Shift-F5; just be patient.
	<li>I normally run with Nested Multiple/Dynamic/Plus disabled, coz Nested
	 Unary always, AFAIK, hints, as my catch-all.
	</ul>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>
<h2>Extranious S__t</h2><ul>
<li><b>Cheats</b> I should mention the GUI's cheats. The GUI has some cheats,
 but they're ____all use. Just use the hints. I wrote the cheats just to write
 some obfuscated code, because s__t wasn't complicated enough already, so I
 complicated it some more, and then decomplicated it, because I can't ever make
 up my mind about anything, because made-up minds are fascile. Learn. Grow.
 Adapt.
<li><b>LogicalSolverTester</b> If you want an itemised solution then run the
 LogicalSolverTester over the puzzle and look at the log file. That's why I
 haven't bothered with it in the GUI. I figure most users don't want it, and
 those that do also want a batch. LST solves a MagicTour (.mt) file containing
 multiple (upto 9999) puzzles, just to see how quickly we can do it; and has
 verbose logging to show all the hints used to solve each puzzle, which is how
 I find puzzles for my test-cases. You can also now Shft-F9 for verbose analyse
 (in the GUI log-file) or even Alt-F9 for super-verbose (individual hinters).
<li><b>top1465</b> My "standard" test data file is top1465.d5.mt. It contains
 1465 Sudoku puzzles in "approximate" order of hardest to easiest. I need a
 variety of puzzles to exercise my hinters, and a "standard" for comparative
 performance testing:<ul>
 <li>All timings are on an ~2900 Mhz intel i7 notebook solving top1465.d5.mt.
 <li>As a baseline, the original Juillerat implementation took 22 minutes.
 <li>In accuracy (default) mode, with all hinters enabled (all A*E hacked)
  mine took 37 minutes. So SE has a wheel alignment problem! Sigh. BIG Sigh.
 <li>so I <b>disable</b> all but "the original" hinters and it takes 1:33 which
  is "fast enough" in my humble opinion. Anything under 4 minutes feels "pretty
  snappy" in the GUI, but three minutes is nicer. Under 10 minutes still feels
  OK to me. I reckon under 20 minutes would be "acceptable" to most users, but
  beyond that it really starts to feel like someone's nicked your lunch-money.
 <li>Asat 2021-07-10 my "preferred" hinters also take 1:33, which is nice.
  See the "Selecting Solving Techniques" section above. 
 <li>Sticking turbo=true in DiufSudoku_Settings.txt produced a 1:05 pass, but
  it blows my head-gasket. Ergo I reckon turbo is cheating, but what a cheat!
 <li><b>diuf.sudoku.BuildTimings</b> contains the hinters-summary of previous
  batch .logs, to see if we're progressing through time. Or ask a physicist.
 </ul>
<li><b>RecursiveSolverTester</b> is fast. It's Knuth's recursive algorithm plus
 Four Quick Foxes plus Cell.set(AUTOSOLVE=true) equals top1465 in 916 ms; which
 is paramount to FTL-travel, IMHO. All I did was tune-it-up. Note that this is
 (I presume) not repeatable in the current version, because Cell.set is now
 "non-aggressive". The "aggressive" version is still available to techies only
 via a the hard-coded Grid.AUTOSOLVE switch.
<li><b>Test-cases</b> I should also mention test-cases. There are test-cases.
 No guarantees on quality. Minimal and optimistic. Less code equals more speed.
 My bug-bear with test-cases is that they're commonly harder to change than the
 code, so test-cases are only for people who make up there minds, there-after
 refusing to adapt, denying the necessity of doing so.
