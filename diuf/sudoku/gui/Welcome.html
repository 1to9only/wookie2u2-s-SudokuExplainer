If you're having trouble reading this then right-click in this hint details
area (ie here) to copy the HTML to the clipboard, paste it into temp.html and
open it in your browser, which will allow you to enlarge the font. The hints
TreeView (upper right) also has this right-click to copy feature. If the GUI
fonts are too small then all I can offer is Windows magnifying glass, it's in
accessibility settings. Sorry I can't be more help: GUI's just s__t me.

<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>
<b>Sudoku Explainer</b> tries to cater for everyone who's interested in Sudoku
puzzles, from wee gromets up to Western European university professors, but the
focus is on hard (ie beyond a humans ability to solve) puzzles.
<p>
The Techniques herein have been described as "old school". That's fine with me.
I've added techniques from HoDoKu and Sukaku in order to mitigate this valid
criticism. They're not faster, they're just simpler. My initial focus was TOO
performance-centric. The downside is you'll probably want to unwant slow techs.
<p>
<b>Sudoku Explainer</b> shows you how to solve any Sudoku puzzle step by step,
explaining each solving technique as it's applied. It also allows you to get
<b><i>all</i></b> the hints (ie solving techniques) that can be applied to a
puzzle, and to apply any or all of them (singularly or multiply).
<p>
<b>Sudoku Explainer</b> solves "the worlds hardest Sudoku puzzle" according to
conceptis.com in 125.610 seconds with all A*E's enabled and unhacked on my i7
(see the Solving techniques section below for my config preferences):
<pre>
8..........36......7..9.2...5...7.......457.....1...3...1....68..85...1..9....4..
(copy-and-paste this puzzle (Edit menu ~ Paste grid) then press F9 to analyse).
</pre>
<p>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>
If you just want a bit of help with a puzzle then the first step is punching
it in. Either left-click on the small grey digit (the maybe) so set the cells
value, or with the keyboard: navigate to the cell-to-be-set with the arrow-keys
and then press the digit key: 1..9.
<p>
Spacebar, delete, backspace, or 0 (zero) all clear the current cell value.
If you stuff-up then Ctrl-Z goes back one step at a time. Ctrl-Y does a redo.
<p>
When you've got your whole puzzle punched-in do NOT forget to Ctrl-S for save
BEFORE you start solving it. A reload might be handy. I always forget to save.
Sigh.
<p>
If you get stuck press F5 for a hint. To apply that hint and get the next one
just press enter.
<p>
Anyway, that's probably enough to get you started. Have fun with it. Come back
and read the advanced stuff when you get bored.
<p>
<h2>Advanced Stuff</h2>
<p>
More "advanced" Sudokuists will want to remove maybes (potential values).
That's those small grey digits in the empty cells. To do that just right-click
on the small grey digit, or with the keyboard: select the cell with the arrow
keys and then Ctrl-digit to remove/restore the maybe. You can't restore an
illegal maybe.
<p>
You'll notice that <b>Sudoku Explainer</b> enforces the basic rule of Sudoku:
<i>"There will be one-and-only-one instance of each value in each region"</i>.
So when you punch a 7 into a cell then all the 7's disappear from the other
cells in it's box (the 3x3 thingummy), row (horizontal), and col (vertical).
<p>
Sudoku puzzle books are all a bit soft (it's an expert scale) so just seeing the
maybes could get you unstuck; but if not then press F5 to find a hint. Then you
can just press enter to apply that hint and get the next one, and the next, and
the next... Sudoku Solvered! Too Bloody Easy!
<p>
The following "frequently used" <b>buttons</b> are arranged along the bottom
of the form (I never use the buttons. I do hope they still work):
<ul>
 <li><b>Clear hints</b> clears the hints tree and refreshes the Sudoku grid.
 <li><b>Solve step</b> applies the selected hint (if any) and gets the next
  (simplest possible) step in solving the puzzle. Click the [Solve step]
  button again to apply the selected hint, and get the next one; or just
  double-click on the hint in the hints tree, or click in the hintsTree (to
  select it) and press enter. That's how to watch the Sudoku puzzle being 
  solved: Just Keep Pressing Enter! which takes all the fun out of it really.
  Sigh. Except that SE solves any Sudoku puzzle, even really <i>really</i>
  <i><b>really</b></i> hard ones (like conceptis's above), and my challenge is
  to solve all <u>possible</u> Sudoku puzzles using logic, and to do so faster
  than everybody-else, mainly because whacking-off gets boring eventually, I
  had superfluous hair (sigh), and it was there.
 <li><b>Get next hint</b> to get hints again without applying the current one.
  Why would you do that? Because there's a button for it, obviously!<br>
 <li><b>Apply hint</b> to apply the current hint, without getting the next one.
  You can select multiple hints in the HintsTree and apply them all with this
  button; or Just Press Enter! Dunno why you'd actually do that, but it is
  possible, because there's a button for it, which is nice really, isn't it.
 <li><b>Get all hints</b> which can be applied to the current grid. Hold down
  the shift key to get even more hints, but be forewarned, this can take a
  a minute or three on my i7. The HintsTree is grouped by category &amp;
  hinter, in increasing order of difficulty (now increasing eliminations).
  You'll need to expand each category by clicking on it. Be warned that 20,000+
  hints may be produced, so the GUI bogs, especially when "Filter hints" is NOT
  selected. It filters with the old "does it remove any NEW maybes" trick. So
  if all of a-more-complex-hints actions (cells set &amp; maybes eliminated)
  are already covered by a simpler hint then the latter is suppressed, which
  keeps the hint-count down, so the GUI doesn't bog.
 <li>It's also worth noting that the larger Aligned*Exclusion hints can take
  several (maybe 5) seconds to DOM-parse because of profligate color tags.
  A GUI programmer with HTML/styles knowledge could help here. I wouldn't have
  a clue what a style is. I don't have any.
</ul>
<p>Some other stuff also worth a mention:
<ul>
 <li><b>File menu ~ load next Puzzle</b> or just Ctrl-P loads the "next"
  puzzle. The meaning of "next" depends on what you've got open. The <i>.mt</i>
  files (magic-tour) are a multi-puzzle format, but next on a <i>.txt</i> file
  opens the next text-file in the current directory. <b>NOTE</b> that when you
  open the next puzzle Sudoku Explainer analyses the puzzle automatically,
  which may take a while, depending on the difficulty of the puzzle and which
  Solving Techniques you've got enabled.
 <li><b>File menu ~ Reload</b> (Alt-F-R) or just Ctrl-R reloads the saved
  puzzle from disk. I find this really handy. It'll even let you try chaining
  manually, if you're over 90, have a decade to kill, and are <b>SERIOUSLY</b>
  sexually frustrated but find that you no longer have the manual dexte....
  Never mind. Ctrl-R to reload the puzzle. OK?
 <li><b>File menu ~ log View</b> for techies: view hints of a type in the .log
  of a previous LogicalSolverTester run, to re/exercise the hinter/s and/or see
  how hinttype/s look in GUI.
 <li><b>Tools menu ~ Reset Potential Values</b> restores the maybes in the
  current grid, which is handy if you bugger-it-all-up and want to restore the
  grid to a valid state before trying again. But note that reset PV's doesn't
  remove cell values, even if they're wrong.
 <li><b>F6 - Get a clue</b> points you towards the next step. Shift-F6 gives
  you a bit more information (it's basically the hint for simpler techniques).
  For harder techniques a clue is the help I think I should want when solving
  a Sudoku manually because it tells me which technique to apply next, 
  allowing me to skip all the inapplicable techniques; but what I actually use
  is the hints, but I'm a programmer, so for me the challenge is writing the
  code to produce the hints to solve all Sudoku puzzles, not solving A puzzle,
  as I presume it is for most people. Clues are there if you want them.
 <li><b>F7 - Check validity</b> checks that there are no doubled values; that
  each empty cell has at least 1 potential value; that all regions have a
  possible location for each unplaced value; and finally that the Sudoku has
  a unique (one and only one) solution. This is pretty handy. I'm not really
  surprised (just disgusted) at the prevalence of blatant basic invalidities
  (like 16 clues) in published Sudokus, because morons are always in a hurry.
 <li><b>F9 - Analyse</b> tells you how hard the puzzle is, and gives you a
  summary of steps which may be used to solve it. Note that this is far from
  the only solution to the puzzle, it's just <b>a</b> (not THE) simplest recipe
  with the enabled Solving Techniques. There may be other shorter recipes that
  don't increase the difficulty. I'm not seeking the shortest simplest path,
  just the simplest; because that's simpler. Yeah? A real guru could do better,
  I'm sure. Contemplating <i>A*</i>ing edges this meaty scares me. sigh.
 <li>If you want an itemised solution then run the LogicalSolverTester over the
  puzzle and look at the log file. That's why I haven't bothered with it in the
  GUI. I figure most users don't want it, and those that do also want a batch.
 <li><b>Options ~ Solving techniques...</b> allows you to select which Sudoko
  solving techniques are applicable:
  <ul>
   <li>Naked Singles, Hidden Singles, Dynamic Plus and Nested Plus are
	mandatory, so there CheckBoxes are checked and disabled.
   <li>You can't disable singles because they're "core" techniques. It makes no
	sense to try to solve a Sudoko without them.
   <li>Dynamic Plus is a catch-all. It's a bit slow, but misses only on the 
	hardest puzzles. Nested Plus is really slow, mandatory, and ALWAYS hints;
	in fact Nested Unary (faster) also never fails to find a hint, so maybe it
	should be the catch-all instead, except that'd preclude Nested Multiple and
	Nested Plus, where the real disenhirsuterative fun is. sigh.
   <li><i>Direct*</i> are useless, but which I mean when they're unchecked the
	hints are still found by there non-direct equivalents. Direct just runs the
	same algorithm twice on each pass, which is a waste of time.
   <li>Naked Pent and Hidden Pent are both degenerate, which means that every
	hint is the agglomerate of two simpler techniques. In practice this means
	they don't hint, because we execute solving techniques in (approximate)
	increasing order of complexity.
   <li>Mutant Swampfish is degenerate to Finned and Franken Swampfish, so use
	either (Finned Swampfish and Franken Swampfish) OR Mutant Swampfish, but not
	all three, or Mutant Swampfish finds no hints, which is a waste of time.
   <li>The same sort-of-applies to Mutant Swordfish and Mutant Jellyfish. All
	Finned and Franken hints are found by the Mutant hinters, along with the
	Mutant-only combinations, because filtering them out is slower; so if you
	want the Mutants you can drop Finned and Mutant. Just be prepared to wait.
   <li>BE WARNED: Mutant Jellyfish are TOO SLOW (about 20 minutes for top1465).
   <li><b>Aligned Ally</b> (one up from Diagon Ally;-):
    <ul>
    <li><i>Aligned Pair</i> is fast,
    <li><i>Aligned Triple</i> is fast enough,
    <li><i>Aligned Quad</i> is acceptable,
    <li><i>Aligned Pent</i> is acceptable (I go unhacked),
    <li><i>Aligned Hex</i> is acceptable (I go unhacked),
    <li><i>Aligned Sept</i> is too slow unhacked, and acceptable hacked but
     then hints very rarely. sigh.
    <li>BE WARNED: Unhacked <i>Aligned Oct, Nona and Dec</i> are so slow there's
     an APB out on them from the <i>School of Algorithmic Incontinence</i> at
	 the <i>Walgatt College of Ear Wax Removal and Advanced Masturbation</i>.
	 My advise is don't use A8+E. They're as rare as chickens lips anyways.
    <li>BE WARNED: The "correct" Aligned Dec runs for a <b>____ING DAY</b>!!!!
	<li>Suggestions on AE'ing faster are welcome. City life's made him a bit
	 slow, Redge.
    </ul>
   <li><b>Whips &amp; Chainers:</b>
    <ul>
    <li>The <b>Chainers</b> are now so fast compared to the AE debacle that I
	 really don't know why you'd disable them, except maybe Nested* if you're
	 impatient with Shift-F5. I use all Chainers, but not Nested*.
    <li><i>Unary Chain</i> would be better named Unary Chains and Bidirectional
	 Cycles, but that's just too bloody long. Dynamic Chain finds Unary Chains,
	 but not Bidirectional Cycles, which are "pretty rare" anyways.
    <li><i>Nishio Chain</i> is when an assumption has contradictory effects,
	 hence the assumption must be wrong.
    <li><i>Multiple Chain</i> starts from a cell with two <i>or more</i>
     potential values. If you unwant Multiple then Dynamic takes longer, which
	 is faster overall; but there's no distinction between static and dynamic
	 chaining, so hints are incorrectly rated harder than they really are.
    <li><i>Dynamic Chain</i> removes maybes from the grid to track effects of
	 each assumption, playing "who's your daddy" on Ass. sigh. Dynamic Chain
	 finds Unary Chains (but not Cycles) and Multiple Chains. I use Dynamic.
    <li><i>Dynamic Plus</i> applies Four Quick Foxes (Locking, NakedPair,
	 HiddenPair, Swampfish) on top of dynamic chains.<br>
	 This only fails to find a hint on expert level puzzles. Normal people can
	 rely on it to always find a hint. It's check box is disabled so you can't
	 disable it, unless you're a programmer.
    <li><i>Nested Unary</i> always (AFAIK) hints, even on the worlds hardest
     puzzle (above). "Normal" people can disable it with confidence.
    <li><i>Nested Multiple/Dynamic/Plus Chains</i> aren't ever used in anger.
	 They exist solely for the amusement of afficionados. You can see them with
	 Shift-F5; just be patient.
	<li>I normally run with Nested Unary/Multiple/Dynamic disabled, but
	 <i>Nested Plus</i> is always enabled, as the ultimate catch-all.
    </ul>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>
I should also mention the <b>LogicalSolverTester</b>, which solves a MagicTour
(.mt) file containing multiple (upto 9999) puzzles, just to see how quickly we
can do it; and verbose logging shows all the hints used to solve each puzzle,
which is how I find puzzles for my test-cases.
<p>
My "standard" test data file is top1465.d5.mt. It contains 1465 Sudoku puzzles
in "approximate" order of hardest to easiest. I need a variety of puzzles to
exercise my hinters, and a "standard" for comparative performance testing.
<ul>
 <li>All timings are on an ~2900 Mhz intel i7 notebook solving top1465.d5.mt.
 <li>As a baseline, the original Juillerat implementation took 22 minutes.
 <li>In accuracy (default) mode, with all hinters enabled (all A*E hacked)
  mine took 37 minutes. So SE has an exclusion problem! sigh.
 <li>so I <b>disable</b> all but "the original" hinters and it takes 1:33,
  which is "fast enough" in my humble opinion; in fact anything under 10 mins
  "feels pretty snappy" in the GUI. Anything under 20 mins is "acceptable".
</ul>
<p>
Try <b>RecursiveSolverTester</b> for speed. It's Knuth's recursive algorithm
+ Four Quick Foxes + Cell.set(AUTOSOLVE) = top1465.d5.mt in 916 ms;
which is FTL, IMHO. All I did was tweak it.
