  <h2>This Sudoku is not valid</h2>
  <p>
   Some potential values that are part of the solution are missing in some
   empty cells. But the Sudoku has a solution if the missing potential
   values are ignored.
  </p>
  <p>
   This probably means that you have <i>manually</i> removed a potential
   value that was part of the solution.
  </p>
  <p>
   Choose <b><i>menu ~ Tools ~ Reset potential values</i></b> to re-compute
   all the potential values of all the empty cells.
   Then you can try again solving this Sudoku.
