<h2>This Hint is Irrelevant.</h2>
<p>
<b>Oops! My bad!</b>
<p>
Sorry, but this hint is broken. It was generated from irrelevant data. Strictly
speaking, it shouldn't have been generated, but it was, so here we are.
<p>
<pre>
The funny thing is that detecting this situation without going through 
<b>all the rigmarole</b> to build the hints HTML requires us to go through
<b>all the rigmarole</b> to build the hints HTML!
</pre>
<p>
So we don't detect this situation when creating hints because doing so involves
thousands of expensive operations, which we don't want to invest our time in at
the time; so we just deal with <i>"the odd one"</i> here, where we're doing most
of the required work anyway... but if this ever becomes more than <i>"the odd
one"</i> then we'll have to wear the cost of detecting these irrelevant bloody
hints "properly" upstream.
<p>
KRC 2019-12-17 The ExcludedCombosMap now goes most of the way towards detecting
and rejecting these irrelevant hints, but it's only a partial solution, which
isn't a solution, but we'll see this message a lot less often now, which is an
improvement, and that's what I'm here for. If you can't solve it then find a way
to stop it annoying the crap out of you until you can work out how to solve it.
Leave it with me.
