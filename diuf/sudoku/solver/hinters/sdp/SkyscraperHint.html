<h2>HoDoKu Skyscraper</h2>
<p>
There are only two possible positions for the value <b>{0}</b> in both
<b><b1>{1}</b1></b> and <b><b1>{2}</b1></b> and two of those cells are
also in the same {3}, so one of the two cells in the "misaligned end"
must contain {0}.
<p>
Hence siblings of both cells in the "misaligned end" cannot be <b>{0}</b>.
<p>
Therefore <r>we can remove <b>{4}</b></r>.
<hr>
<u>Note</u>
<p>
All Skyscrapers are found by the Unary Chainer. The Skyscraper hinter exists
because it's the fastest way to find this narrower pattern. Sudoku Explainer is
probably faster without it, but this applies to many hinters. Many patterns are
simplifications of a heavy generalised pattern, most commonly a Chainer.
