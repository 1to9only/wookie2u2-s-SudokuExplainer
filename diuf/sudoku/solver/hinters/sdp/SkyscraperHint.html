  <h2>HoDoKu Skyscraper</h2>
  <p>
    There are only two possible positions for the value <b>{0}</b> in both
    <b><b1>{1}</b1></b> and <b><b1>{2}</b1></b> and two of those cells are
    also in the same {3}, so there are only two possible configurations,
    therefore <r>cells that are siblings</r> of cells in both possible
    configurations cannot be <b>{0}</b>.
