<h2>HoDoKu Skyscraper</h2>
<p>
There are only two possible positions for the value <b>{0}</b> in both
<b><b1>{1}</b1></b> and <b><b1>{2}</b1></b> and two of those cells are
also in the same {3}, so one of the two cells in the <g>"misaligned end"</g>
must contain {0}.
<p>
Hence siblings of both cells in the "misaligned end" cannot be <b>{0}</b>.
<p>
Therefore <r>we can remove <b>{4}</b></r>.

<u>To Be or Not To Be</u>
<p>
The Chainers find all Skyscraper's (SS's) among others, but SS finds this
specific pattern faster, and IMHO an SS hint is easier to follow, so I contend
that SS is a simpler hint-type, hence SE has SSs, but leaves using them (or not)
up to you. Personally I want SS, but you may demur.
