<h2>HoDoKu Skyscraper</h2>
<p>
There are only two possible positions for the value <b>{0}</b> in both
<b><b1>{1}</b1></b> and <b><b1>{2}</b1></b> and two of those cells are
also in the same {3}, so one of the two cells in the "misaligned end"
must contain {0}.
<p>
Hence siblings of both cells in the "misaligned end" cannot be <b>{0}</b>.
<p>
Therefore <r>we can remove <b>{4}</b></r>.
