<h2>HoDoKu Empty Rectangle</h2>
<p>
No matter where you put <b1><b>{0}</b></b1> in <b1><b>{1}</b></b1>
the cell <b>{2}</b> cannot contain the value <b>{0}</b>.
<p>
If the value <b1><b>{0}</b></b1> is in <b2><b>{3}</b></b2> then <b>{8}</b>
can not be <b>{0}</b> (The value can appear only once in the {4}),<br>
so <b>{9}</b> must be <b>{0}</b> (The value must appear in the {6}),<br>
so <b>{2}</b> can not be <b>{0}</b> (The value can appear only once in the {4}).
<p>
If the value <b1><b>{0}</b></b1> is in <b2><b>{5}</b></b2> then <b>{2}</b>
can not be <b>{0}</b> (The value can appear only once in the {6})
<p>
Hence there are only two possible configurations, neither of which allow
<b>{2}</b> to be <b1><b>{0}</b></b1>,<br>
<p>
Therefore <r>we can remove <b>{11}</b></r>.

<u>To Be or Not To Be</u>
<p>
The Chainers find all EmptyRectangle's (ER's) among others, but ER finds this
specific pattern faster, and IMHO an ER hint is easier to follow, so I contend
that ER is a simpler hint-type, hence SE has ERs, but leaves using them (or not)
up to you. Personally I want ER, but you may demur.
