<h2>HoDoKu Two String Kite</h2>
<p>
There are only two places for <b>{0}</b> in both <b><g>{1}</g></b> and
<g><b>{2}</b></g> (the two strings) which intersect in <b><b1>{3}</b1></b>
(the kite), therefore <b>{4}</b> cannot be <b>{0}</b>.
<p>
The logic is: There are only two places for {0} in {1}:<ol>
<li>If {5} is {0} then {7} cannot be {0} (same box),<br>
hence {8} must be {0} (last place in col),<br>
therefore {4} cannot be {0} (same row).</li>
<li>Alternately, if {6} is {0} then {4} cannot be {0} (same col).</li>
</ol>
Hence there are only two places for {0} in {1}, and we have proven (above)
that neither of those places allows {4} to be {0}.
<p>
Therefore <r>we can remove <b>{9}</b></r>.

<u>To Be or Not To Be</u>
<p>
The Chainers find all TwoStringKites (among others) but TSK finds
this specific pattern faster, and IMHO a TSK hint is a bit easier to
follow, so I contend that TSK is a simpler hint-type; hence SE has
TSK, but leaves using them (or not) up to you. Personally I want
TSK because I want speed, but you may demur.
