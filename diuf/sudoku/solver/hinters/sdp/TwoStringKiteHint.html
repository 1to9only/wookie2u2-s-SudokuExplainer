<h2>HoDoKu Two String Kite</h2>
<p>
There are only two places for <b>{0}</b> in both <g><b>{1}</b></g> and
<g><b>{2}</b></g> (the two strings) which intersect in box <b1><b>{3}</b></b1>
(the kite), therefore <b>{4}</b> cannot be <b>{0}</b>.
<p>
The logic is: There are only two possible positions for {0} in {1}:<ol>
<li>If cell {5} is {0} then {7} cannot be {0} (same box),<br>
hence {8} must be {0} (only remaining position in col),<br>
therefore {4} cannot be {0} (same row).</li>
<li>Alternately, if {6} is {0} then {4} cannot be {0} (same col).</li>
</ol>
Hence there's only two places for {0} in {1}, and neither allows {4} to be {0}.
<p>
Therefore <r>we can remove <b>{9}</b></r>.

<u>To Be or Not To Be</u>
<p>
A TwoStringKite (TSK) is a Unary (single digit) Chain; so SEs UnaryChainer finds
all TSK's (among others), but TSK finds this specific pattern faster and in my
humble opinion a TSK hint is easier to follow, so one might argue that TSK is a
simpler hint-type, hence SE has a TSK hinter, but leaves the decision to use it
(or not) up to you. Personally I always use TSK, but you may demur.
