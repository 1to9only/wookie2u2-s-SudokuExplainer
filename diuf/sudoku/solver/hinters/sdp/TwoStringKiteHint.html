<h2>HoDoKu Two String Kite</h2>
<p>
There are only two positions for <b>{0}</b> in both <g><b>{1}</b></g> and
<g><b>{2}</b></g> (the two strings), and they both hit <b1><b>{3}</b></b1>
(the kite), therefore <b>{4}</b> cannot be <b>{0}</b>.
<p>
The logic is: There are only two possible positions for {0} in {1}:<ol>
<li>If cell {5} is {0} then {7} cannot be {0} (same box),<br>
therefore {8} must be {0} (only remaining position in col),<br>
and therefore {4} cannot be {0} (same row).</li>
<li>Alternately, if {6} is {0} then {4} cannot be {0} (same col).</li>
</ol>
Hence there's only two places for {0} in {1}, and neither allows {4} to be {0}.
<p>
Therefore <r>we can remove <b>{9}</b></r>.
