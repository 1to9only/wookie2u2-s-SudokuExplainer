NOTE: The package name: sdp stands for Single Digit Pattern, because these
solving techniques all revolve around a single potential value.

SingleDigitPatternSolver is the name of the HoDoKu class which contained all
the concepts that the hinters in this directory were based on. I have not
copied hobiwans code, just the concepts there-in, but the concepts are the
important part, so kudos should flow back to hobiwan. All mistakes are mine.
