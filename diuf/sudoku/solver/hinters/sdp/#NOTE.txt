NOTE: The package name: sdp stands for Single Digit Pattern, because these
solving techniques all revolve around a single potential value.

EmptyRectange, SkyScraper and TwoStringKite are from SingleDigitPatternSolver.
SingleDigitPatternSolver contains all the concepts for these hinters. I haven't
copied hobiwans code, just the concepts there-in, but the concepts are the big
cheese, so kudos flows back to hobiwan. The mistakes are mine.
