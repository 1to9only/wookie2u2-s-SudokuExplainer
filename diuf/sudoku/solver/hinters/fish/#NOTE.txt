===============================================================================

ComplexFisherman is a reimplementation of BasicFisherman using hobiwans "stack
technique" to search all possible combinations of bases; because it's faster
(but more complex) than Nicholas Juillerats Permutations technique. The next
method of the Permutations class is still a bit slow. A stack is faster, it's
just harder to get your head around how the bastard works.
