<h2>HoDoKu {0}</h2>

{8}
<p>
All the <c>possible positions</c> of the value <b>{1}</b>
in {4} <b1>base {2}s</b1>
are in the same {4} <b2>cover {3}s</b2>;
except <b1>{5}</b1> which {9} extra <b1>fins {7}</b1>,
but each elimination sees all of the fins.
<p>
Hence if any of the fins were {1} then {6} still could not be {1}, and {1} must
either be in the fish or in one of the fins, so either way we can remove {1}
from <b2>covers</b2> except <b1>bases</b1> that see all of the <b1>fins</b1>.
<p>
Therefore <r>we can remove <b>{6}</b></r>.

<u>Explanation</u>
<p>
Finned fish increase the utility of the Fish concept by expanding the number of
hints produced, at the cost of limited eliminations. A prima facea look at fins
says it breaks the core Fish covenant: <i>N</i> bases have <u>only</u> <i>N</i>
places for value, hence the value is "locked into" these bases, but adding the
restriction that each elimination sees all of the fins props-up the whole deal,
so it's logically valid, it's just a bit slow Redge.
<p>
Note that BasicFisherman is S__TLOADS faster than ComplexFisherman coz it's much
simpler. A genius would work-out how to find finned fish efficiently. I'm just a
stupid programmer. This is the best I can do: A bit s__t; and it only gets worse
from here, in terms of complexity, if not time.
