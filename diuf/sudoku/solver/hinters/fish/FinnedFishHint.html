  <h2>HoDoKu {0}</h2>
  <p>
   Nearly all the <c>possible positions</c> of the value <b>{1}</b> in {4}
   different <b1>{2}s</b1> are in the same {4} <b2>{3}s</b2>; the exception
   being {5} which has extra <b1>fins {7}</b1> which may be {1}, but they're
   all in the same box, so if any of the fins were {1} then {6} still couldn't
   be {1}, so either way we can <r>kill off <b>{1}<b> in <b>{6}</b></r>.
