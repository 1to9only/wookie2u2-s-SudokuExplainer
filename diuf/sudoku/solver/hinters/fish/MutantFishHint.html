<h2>HoDoKu {0}</h2>

<p>
All the <c>possible positions</c> of the value <b><g>{1}</g></b>
in {4} <b1>base {2}</b1> are in the same {4} <b2>cover {3}</b2>.
The number of <b1>{2}s</b1> matches the number of <b2>{3}s</b2>,
and each <b1>{2}</b1> must contain the value <g><b>{1}</b></g>;
so each <b2>{3}</b2> will have a <g><b>{1}</b></g> in one of the
<c>intersecting cells</c>.
<p>
Hence <b>{1}</b>'s in the <b2>covers</b2> but not in the <b1>bases</b1> may be
removed.
<p>
Therefore <r>we can remove <b>{6}</b></r>.

<u>Explanation</u>
<p>
Mutant Fish use all three types of regions (box, row, and col) as both base AND
cover regions. Note that MOST mutant eliminations will have already been found
by simpler Fish types, so they don't show-up, and with all three region types in
the search the number of combinations of regions EXPLODES, so searching them is
MUCH slower; but we find a few, so we do it anyway, mainly just because we can.
<p>
Mutant Jellyfish are "too slow to be allowed", as are Kraken Jellyfish, despite
my best efforts. Likewise large Aligned*Exclusion. sigh.
<p>
Note that HoDoKu incorrectly identifies some Mutants as Frankens; but hobiwan's
opinion is, in my opinion, superior to my opinion, so please politely forget
that I ever mentioned it. Maybe we should change the definitions of Franken and
Mutant to align with hobiwans implementation, in his honour. In Sudoku any
opinion is as good as any other, and his was a damn sight better than most.
