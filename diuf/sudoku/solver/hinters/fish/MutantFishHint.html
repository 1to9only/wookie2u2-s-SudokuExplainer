  <h2>HoDoKu {0}</h2>
  <p>
   All the <c>possible positions</c> of the value <b><g>{1}</g></b>
   in {4} different <b1>{2}</b1> are in the same {4} <b2>{3}</b2>.
   The number of <b1>{2}</b1> matches the number of <b2>{3}</b2>,
   and each <b1>{2}</b1> must contain the value <g><b>{1}</b></g>;
   so each <b2>{3}</b2> will have a <g><b>{1}</b></g> in one of the
   <c>intersecting cells</c>.
  <p>
   The <r>other possible positions</r> of the value <b>{1}</b> that are in
   the <b2>{3}</b2> but not in one of the <b1>{2}</b1> may therefore
   be removed.
  <p>
   A Mutant Fish uses ALL three types of regions (row, col and box) as both the
   potential base AND cover regions. Note that MOST mutants eliminations will
   have already been found by simpler Fish types, so they never show-up, and
   the introduction of all three region types greatly expands the number of
   possible combinations of regions, so searching them is a lot slower; but we
   still find a few, so we do it anyway: mainly just because it was there.
  <p>
   Note that HoDoKu incorrectly reports Mutants as Frankens. I'm not going to
   fix it, because the code is MENTAL.
