All the <c>possible positions</c> of the value <b><g>{1}</g></b>
in {4} <b1>base {2}s</b1> are in the same {4} <b2>cover {3}s</b2>.
The number of <b1>bases</b1> matches the number of <b2>covers</b2>,
and each <b1>base</b1> must contain the value <g><b>{1}</b></g>;
so each <b2>cover</b2> will have a <g><b>{1}</b></g> in one of the
<c>intersecting cells</c>.
<p>
Hence other possible positions of <b>{1}</b> in the <b2>{3}s</b2> but not in
one of the <b1>{2}s</b1> may be removed.
<p>
Therefore <r>we can remove <b>{6}</b></r>.

<u>Explanation</u>
<p>
A Franken Fish has a box as at least one of the base OR cover regions.
In a basic fish all regions are rows/cols and covers are cols/rows.
In Frankenland we throw in boxs as bases OR covers, but not both.
That's all. All the other Fish rules remain unchanged.
<p>
Note that Hodoku mixes-up Frankens and Mutants. Everybody is entitled to there
own definition, especially when we get into the nitty-gritty, hence hobiwans
definition of Franken verses Mutant is as equally valid/invalid as mine. There
really is more than one way to do it! My definition is just a tad "squarer", I
think, for now, sort of. Oh, forget I ever mentioned it.
<p>
It is also worth mentioning that all (AFAIK) Franken hints are region chains on
the box, that is these eliminations can be achieved by "No matter where you put
the value in the box, these eliminations are produced", but region chaining is
faster coz fish does fak(bases)*fak(covers) calculations; whereas the chainer
just checks consequences of every place for value in box, which is O(n); hence
I cannot recommend Franken. Use Franken if you like, they are still fast enough,
but drop "Finned ${This}fish" coz Franken finds them also. There is no more
bananas for covering the same fak*fak ____er twice. Fak means factorial, by the
way. All you need to know is fak*fak is MUCH bigger than n, so if you must go
fak*fak then bloody-well reduce n! Franken fails this test, by adding boxs.
