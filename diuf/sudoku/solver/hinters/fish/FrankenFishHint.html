   All the <c>possible positions</c> of the value <b><g>{1}</g></b>
   in {4} different <b1>regions</b1> are in the same {4} <b2>{3}s</b2>.
   The number of <b1>regions</b1> matches the number of <b2>{3}s</b2>,
   and each <b1>region</b1> must contain the value <g><b>{1}</b></g>;
   so each <b2>{3}</b2> will have a <g><b>{1}</b></g> in one of the
   <c>intersecting cells</c>.
  <p>
   The <r>other possible positions</r> of the value <b>{1}</b> that are in
   the <b2>{3}s</b2> but not in one of the <b1>regions</b1> may therefore
   be removed.
  <p>
   <b>Franken Fish</b> has a box as at least one of the base OR cover regions.
   In a basic fish all regions are rows/cols and covers are cols/rows.
   In a franken fish we just throw a box into the possible bases OR covers.
   That's all. All the other Fish rules remain unchanged.
