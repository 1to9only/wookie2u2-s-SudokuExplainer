All the <c>possible positions</c> of the value <b><g>{1}</g></b>
in {4} <b1>base {2}s</b1> are in the same {4} <b2>cover {3}s</b2>.
The number of <b1>bases</b1> matches the number of <b2>covers</b2>,
and each <b1>base</b1> must contain the value <g><b>{1}</b></g>;
so each <b2>cover</b2> will have a <g><b>{1}</b></g> in one of the
<c>intersecting cells</c>.
<p>
Hence other possible positions of <b>{1}</b> in the <b2>{3}s</b2> but not in
one of the <b1>{2}s</b1> may be removed.
<p>
Therefore <r>we can remove <b>{6}</b></r>.
<p>
<u>Explanation</u>
<p>
A Franken Fish has a box as at least one of the base OR cover regions.
In a basic fish all regions are rows/cols and covers are cols/rows.
In Frankenland we throw in boxs as bases OR covers, but not both.
That's all. All the other Fish rules remain unchanged.
<p>
Note that Hodoku mixes-up Frankens and Mutants. Everybody is entitled to there
own definition, especially when we get into the nitty-gritty, hence hobiwans
definition of Franken verses Mutant is as equally valid/invalid as mine. There
is more than one way to do it! My definition is just a tad "squarer", I think,
for now, sort of. Oh, forget I ever mentioned it.
