This original align package is still partially used. I've been trying to replace
it with the new align2 package; but ran into a performance quagmire.

Aligned234Exclusion are no longer used; they've been superceeded by the new
align2.AlignedExclusion class, which is actually a tad faster than this ugly
old bitch.

Aligned5+Exclusion are still used, and they're the slow ones, where it really
matters. A5E is 5 times slower. A6E is 6 times slower. A7E is 7 times slower,
and presumably like-wise for A8910E, which are already FAR too slow; so I give
up, and keep using this ugly old bitch. There's a reason they think she's a
witch! It's a fair cop really.

align2 is my attempt to eliminate the profusion of unmaintainable boiler-plate
code, each customised to it's specific task, for performance; but I can't get
it into the same ball-park, so I'm sticking with the original align package for
now, until some magic happens to reveal an Aligned Exclusion algorithm that is
atleast ten (and preferably a hundred) times faster. sigh.
