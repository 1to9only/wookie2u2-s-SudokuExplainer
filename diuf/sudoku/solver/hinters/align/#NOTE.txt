The align package is still partially used. I've been trying to replace it with
a new align2 package; but run into the same old performance quagmire.

Aligned234Exclusion are no longer used; they've been superceeded by align2,
which is actually a tad faster than it's ugly old counterparts.

Aligned5+Exclusion are still used, and they're the slow ones, where it really
matters. The new version of A5E is like 5 times slower. The new A6E is like 6
times slower. The new A7E is like 7 times slower, and presumably similar for
A8910E, which are already FAR too slow; so I give up, and keep the ugly old
cheesy smelly warty verbose boiler-plate unmaintainable align package.

There's a reason they think she's a witch!

align2 is my attempt to eliminate the profusion of unmaintainable boiler-plate
code, each customised to it's specific task, for performance; but I just can't
get it into the same ball park, so I'm sticking with the original align package
for now, until some magic happens to reveal an Aligned Exclusion algorithm that
is atleast twice as efficient; and preferably 100 times faster. sigh.
