align2 is only partially used.

The align2 package was written to replace the align package debacle. It's an
attempt to do AlignedExclusion far more succinctly. align is boiler-plate mad.
align2 is simpler (but therefore more complex, sigh) and works OK but it's
slower (big sigh), so I still use the old align package.

To use align2 instead change LogicalSolver.configureHinters.

Note: the two packages operate independently of each other: each package has all
it's own "supporting" classes. Classes with the same names have the same origin,
but may now differ in content. Diff them to find out. The point is that align2
was written to replace the whole align package, which was to be deleted.

2021-04-27: align2 now used for A234E, where it's a bit faster than it's boiler
plate counterparts, but it's still MUCH slower for A5E+ where the original align
package, if anything, is used. I don't use A*E any longer, coz it's too slow,
and most of it's former hints are found further up the hint-stack. I won't use
A*E until I dream-up an implementation that's an order of magnitude faster; no
small order. So for the moment it's a dead-duck. sigh.
