<h2>HoDoKu ALS-XZ</h2>
<p>
The two Almost Locked Sets (ALSs):<pre>
 (a) <b1>{0}</b1>
 (b) <b2>{1}</b2>
</pre>
share the Restricted Common Candidate (RCC) x = {2}{6}.
<p>
All x's ({2}'s) in both ALSs see each other (that's the Restriction) so only one
of these two ALSs can contain a {2}, so the other ALS will contain the other
common value z {3}.
<p>
Hence no cell which sees all {3}'s in both ALSs may be {3}.
<p>
Therefore <r>we can remove <b>{4}</b></r>. 
<p>
<u>Explanation</u>
<p>
The logic is: all x's in these two ALS's see each other, so that x will be in
one of these two ALS's, which "pushes" the other common value z into the other
ALS (we don't know yet which is which), so other cells which see all z's in
both ALS's are history.
<p>
The "push" is the tricky bit. Each ALS may loose only <u>one</u> value before it goes
invalid. If ALS-A has {2} it pushes the {3} into the other ALS. ALS-A cannot
have both {2} and {3} because it leaves ALS-B with insufficient values to cover
it's cells. Hence the other common value z ({3}) is "pushed" into the other ALS.
<p>
<u>ALS Blurb</u>
<p>
An "Almost Locked Set" (ALS) is exactly what it sounds like.
A Naked/Hidden Pair/Triple/Quad/etc is a "Locked Set",
and an ALS is "almost locked" because it has just has one more potential value
than its number of cells, so if any value where removed from those cells it
becomes a Locked Set. Further, each ALS may loose only one value before it
goes invalid because it has insufficient potential values to fill it's cells.
<p>
ALSs are not very useful until we chain them together in groups of 2=ALS-XZ,
3=ALS-Wing, or more=ALS-Chains; or Death Blossom, or Big Wings, or whatever;
the point is that additional logic is applied to ALS's to produce hints.
<p>
An ALS-XZ is an ALS-Chain of length 2. ALS-XZs and ALS-Wings have slightly
different rules, so they are handled separately to ALS-Chains, and so have
differentiating hint-type names.
In ALS-XZ and ALS-Wings the RCC (x) is allowed to appear in the overlap, if any,
of each pair of ALSs, in ALS-Chains this is forbidden because it breaks the "and
reciprocally" rule. There are other extraneous differences. If you really want
to know then you need to read the code, but that's the crux of it.
