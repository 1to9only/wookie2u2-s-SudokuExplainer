<h2>HoDoKu ALS-XZ</h2>
<p>
These two Almost Locked Sets (ALSs) are aligned:<pre>
    (a) <b1>{0}</b1>
    (b) <b2>{1}</b2>
</pre>
They share the Restricted Common Candidate (RCC) x = {2}{6}.
<p>
All x = {2}'s in both ALSs see each other (that's the Restriction) so only one
of these two ALSs will contain a {2}, so the other ALS must contain the other
common value z = {3}.
<p>
Hence {3} may be eliminated from external cells seeing all {3}'s in <u>both</u>
ALSs.
<p>
Therefore <r>we can remove <b>{4}</b></r>.

<p>
<u>Explanation</u>
<p>
The logic is: all x's in these two ALS's see each other, so that x must be in
one of these two ALS's, which "pushes" the other common value z into the other
ALS, because only one value can be removed from an ALS before it goes invalid.
We don't yet know which ALS is which, but that doesn't matter because we
eliminate only from cells seeing all z's in <u>both</u> of these ALSs.
<p>
The "push" is the tricky bit. The rule is that each ALS can loose only <u>one</u>
value before going invalid. But why? ALS-A cannot contain both {2} and {3}
because that leaves ALS-B with not enough values to place one value in each of
its cells; ergo the Sudoku is invalid, and we MUST avoid sending the Sudoku
invalid.
<p>
<u>ALS Blurb</u>
<p>
An "Almost Locked Set" (ALS) is exactly what it sounds like.
A Naked Pair/Triple/Quad/etc is the simplest "Locked Set", and an ALS is "almost
locked" because it has just has one more potential value than its number of
cells, so if any value where removed from those cells it becomes a Locked Set.
Further, each ALS may loose only one value before it goes invalid because 
eliminating a second value leaves it with insufficient potential values to fill
all of it's cells.
<p>
ALSs are not very useful until we chain them together in groups of 2=ALS_XZ,
3=ALS_Wing, or more=ALS_Chain; or Death Blossom, or Big Wings, or whatever;
the point is that additional logic needs to be applied to ALSs in order to
produce a hint.
<p>
An ALS-XZ is an ALS-Chain of length 2. ALS-XZs and ALS-Wings have slightly
different rules, so they are handled separately to ALS-Chains, and so have
differentiating hint-type names.
In ALS-XZ and ALS-Wings the RCC (x) is allowed to appear in the overlap, if any,
of each pair of ALSs, in ALS-Chains this is forbidden because it breaks the "and
reciprocally" rule. There are other extraneous differences. If you really want
to know then you need to read the code, but that's the crux of it.
<p>
I later renamed the tech's: ALS_Pair..ALS_Sept. Note that you CAN have chains
longer than 7, but work increases exponentially while the number of hints fall
away, so 7 is barking, and 8 would be beyond slow and probably not hint at all.
