<h2>HoDoKu ALS-XZ</h2>
<p>
The two Almost Locked Sets (ALSs):<pre>
 (a) <b1>{0}</b1>
 (b) <b2>{1}</b2>
</pre>
share the Restricted Common Candidate (RCC) x = {2}{6}.
<p>
All x's ({2}'s) in both ALSs see each other (that's the Restriction) so only one
of these two ALSs can contain a {2}, so the other ALS will contain the other
common value z {3}.
<p>
Hence no cell which sees all {3}'s in both ALSs may be {3}.
<p>
Therefore <r>we can remove <b>{4}</b></r>. 
<p>
<u>Explanation</u>
<p>
The logic is: all x's in these two ALS's see each other, so that x will be in
one of these two ALS's, which "pushes" the other common value z into the other
ALS (we don't know yet which is which), so other cells which see all z's in
both ALS's are history.
<p>
The "push" is the tricky bit. Each ALS may loose only <u>one</u> value before it
goes invalid. So for instance, if ALS-A has {2} then the {3} is pushed into the
other ALS. ALS-A can't have both {2} and {3} because that leaves ALS-B with
insufficient values to fill it's cells, which is invalid. Hence the other common
value z ({3}) is "pushed" into the other ALS.
<p>
<u>ALS Blurb</u>
<p>
An "Almost Locked Set" (ALS) is exactly what it sounds like.
A Naked/Hidden Pair/Triple/Quad/etc is a "Locked Set",
and an ALS is "almost locked" because it has just has one more potential value than its number of cells,
so if any value where removed from those cells it becomes a Locked Set.
ALSs aren't very useful until we chain them together in groups of
2=ALS-XZ, 3=ALS-Wing, or more=ALS-Chains; or Death Blossom, or Big Wings, or whatever;
the point is that additional logic is always applied on top of ALS's in order to produce hints.
<p>
An ALS-XZ is just an ALS-Chain of length 2. ALS-XZ's and ALS-Wings have slightly
different rules, so they are handled separately to ALS-Chains, and so have
differentiating hint-type names.
In ALS-XZ and ALS-Wings the RCC (x) is allowed to appear in the overlap, if any,
of the two sets, in ALS-Chains this is forbidden because it breaks the "and
reciprocally" rule. There's other extraneous differences (if you really want
to know then you'll have to read the codez) but that's the crux of it.
