  <h2>HoDoKu ALS-XZ</h2>
  <p>
    The two Almost Locked Sets (ALSs):<pre>
     (a) <b1>{0}</b1>
     (b) <b2>{1}</b2>
    </pre>
    share the Restricted Common Candidate (RCC) X = {2}<br>
    and another (non-restricted) common candidate Z = <b>{3}</b>.
  <p>
    All X's ({2}'s) in both ALSs see each other (that's the Restriction) so that
    only one of these two ALSs can contain a {2}, and the other ALS will contain
    the other common value Z {3}, therefore no cell which sees all {3}'s in both
    ALSs may be {3}.
  <p>
    The logic is the RCC ({2}) will turn one of the ALSs into a Locked Set (we
    don't know which yet) and both ALSs also contain digit Z, which is pushed
    into the other ALS. Meaning that in all ALS cells together one Z must be
    placed. Hence any cell which sees all the Z's in both ALSs can not be Z.
  <p>
    Therefore <r><b>{3}</b> can be removed from <b>{4}</b></r>. 
  <p>
    <b>Further explanation</b><br>
    An ALS-XZ is just an ALS-Chain of length 2. An ALS (Almost Locked Set) is
    exactly what it sounds like: A Naked Pair/Triple/Quad is a "Locked Set",
    and an ALS is "almost locked" because it has just has one more potential
    value than its number of cells, so if any value where removed from those
    cells it becomes a Locked Set. ALSs are not at all useful until we chain
    them together in groups of 2 (ALS-XZ), 3 (ALS-XY-Wing), or more (ALS-Chains).
  <p>
    The 2's and 3's have slightly different rules, so they are handled
    differently, so we grant them differentiating hint-type names.
    In ALS-XZ (and ALS-XY-Wings) the RCC (X) is allowed to appear in the
    physical overlap (if any) of the two sets, in ALS-Chains this is forbidden
    because it breaks our "and reciprocally" rule. There are also additional
    eliminations available in double linked ALS-XZs (which this one is not).
