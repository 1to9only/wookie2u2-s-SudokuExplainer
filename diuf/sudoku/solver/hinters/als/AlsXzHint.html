<h2>HoDoKu ALS-XZ</h2>
<p>
The two Almost Locked Sets (ALSs):<pre>
 (a) <b1>{0}</b1>
 (b) <b2>{1}</b2>
</pre>
share the Restricted Common Candidate (RCC) X = {2}<br>
and another (non-restricted) common candidate Z = <b>{3}</b>.
<p>
All X's ({2}'s) in both ALSs see each other (that's the Restriction) so that
only one of these two ALSs can contain a {2}, so the other ALS will contain
the other common value Z {3}.
<p>
Hence no cell which sees all {3}'s in both ALSs may be {3}.
<p>
Therefore <r>we can remove <b>{4}</b></r>. 
<p>
<u>Explanation</u>
The logic is a bit nasty. All X's in these two ALS's see each other, so that
X will be in one of these two ALS's, which "pushes" the other common value z
into the other ALS (we don't know yet which is which), so other cells which see
all z's in both ALS's are history. The "push" part is the tricky bit. Each ALS
may loose only one value before it goes invalid. So for instance, if ALS-A has
{2} then the {3} is pushed into the other ALS. ALS-A can't have both {2} and {3}
because that leaves the other ALS with insufficient values to fill it's cells.
Hence the other common value z ({3}) is always "pushed" into the other ALS.
<p>
An ALS (Almost Locked Set) is exactly what it sounds like: A Naked
Pair/Triple/Quad is a "Locked Set", and an ALS is "almost locked" because it has
just has one more potential value than its number of cells, so if any value
where removed from those cells it becomes a Locked Set. ALSs aren't very useful
until we chain them together in groups of 2: ALS-XZ, 3: ALS-Wing, or more:
ALS-Chains... or Death Blossom, or Big Wing, or whatever; the point is that
additional logic needs to be applied on top of ALS's.
<p>
An ALS-XZ is just an ALS-Chain of length 2. 
ALS-XZ's and ALS-Wings have slightly different rules, so they are handled
separately to ALS-Chains, and so have differentiating hint-type names.
In ALS-XZ and ALS-Wings the RCC (X) is allowed to appear in the overlap, if any,
of the two sets, in ALS-Chains this is forbidden because it breaks the "and
reciprocally" rule.
