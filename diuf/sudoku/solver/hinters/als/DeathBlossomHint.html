<h2>{4}HoDoKu Death Blossom</h2>
<pre><b>
<k>Stem : {0}</k>
ALSs : {1}
</b></pre>
Regardless of the correct value of the stem cell {2}, one of these Almost Locked
Sets (ALSs) will become a Locked Set (LS), and they <b>ALL</b> preclude the same
candidate/s.
<p>
Hence we can eliminate those common candidates/s without knowing which ALS will
become an LS.
<p>
Therefore <r>we can remove <b>{3}</b></r>.

<u>Explanation</u> based on https://www.sudopedia.org/wiki
<p>
A Death Blossom consists of a "stem" cell and an Almost Locked Set (or ALS)
foreach of the stem cell's candidates. The ALS associated with a particular
candidate of the stem cell has that value as one of its own candidates, and
every cell in the ALS that has that value as a candidate sees the stem-cell.
The ALSs can't overlap; ie no cell can belong to more than one ALS. Also, there
must be at least one value that is a candidate of every ALS, and is not a
candidate of the stem cell. These are the value/s (usually one) to eliminate.
<p>
Having found a Death Blossom, the value/s to eliminate (in all ALSs and not in
the stem cell) are eliminated from each outside cell (not in any of the ALSs)
which sees all occurrences of that value in the Death Blossom.

Implementation notes:
<p>
1. Sudoku Explainer handles the elimination of multiple values because there is
nothing to stop a DeathBlossom eliminating multiple values, it's just rarer than
rocking horse s__t. It happens just ONCE (69#top1465.d5.mt) in top1465.
<p>
2. Sudoku Explainer examines stem-cells with upto <b>3</b> maybes, because DB is slow and
top1465 doesn't contain any DB's on stem-cells with 4 values, but I'm too thick
to prove they cannot exist, so the rest of the code handles them (caveat emptor
on this). I guess a stickler for correctness would change that &lt; 4 to &lt; 5,
but I'm prone to excessive efficiency, ergo I'm a lazy bastard.
