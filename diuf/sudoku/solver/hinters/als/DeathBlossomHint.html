Regardless of the correct value of the stem cell {0}, one of these Almost Locked
Sets (ALSs) will become a Locked Set (LS), and <b>ALL</b> of these Locked Sets preclude
the same candidate/s.
<p>
Hence we can eliminate those common candidates/s without knowing which ALS will
become an LS.

<u>Explanation</u> from https://www.sudopedia.org/wiki
<p>
A Death Blossom consists of a "stem" cell and an Almost Locked Set (or ALS)
foreach of the stem cell's candidates. The ALS associated with a particular
candidate of the stem cell has that value as one of its own candidates, and
within the ALS, every cell that has the value as a candidate can see the stem
cell. The ALSs can't overlap; ie no cell can belong to more than one ALS. Also,
there must be at least one value that is a candidate of every ALS, but is not a
candidate of the stem cell. (1) These are the value/s (usually one) to
eliminate.
<p>
Having found a Death Blossom, if an outside cell (not in any of the ALSs) sees
all occurrences of that value (in all ALSs and not in the stem cell) in the
Death Blossom then we can eliminate that value from the outside cell.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
(1) Each value-to-eliminate must be common to all ALSs in the DeathBlossom and
not a potential value of the stem cell; which makes sense: the main logic is
one of the ALSs will become an LS, so all ALSs must share that nonstem-value,
precluding it from external cell/s seeing all instances in the DeathBlossom.
<p>
There's nothing to stop a DeathBlossom eliminating multiple values, it's just
rarer than rocking horse s__t. In fact it never happens in top1465, but SE
handles multiples anyway, just in case, but it's untested, so caveat emptor.
<p>
NOTE: SE's DeathBlossom implementation examines stems with 2 or <u><b>3</b></u>
maybes, because DB is slow and top1465 doesn't have any DB's on 4 values, but I
believe that 4's do exist, so the rest of the code handles them. If you're a
stickler for correctness please change the &lt; 4 to &lt; 5. I am prone to
excessive efficiency, ergo I'm a lazy bastard.
