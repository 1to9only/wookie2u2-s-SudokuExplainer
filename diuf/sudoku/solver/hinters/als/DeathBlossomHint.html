<h2>{3}HoDoKu Death Blossom</h2>
<pre><b>
<k>Stem : {0}</k>
ALSs : {2}
</b></pre>
Regardless of the correct value of the stem cell {0}, one of these Almost Locked
Sets (ALS) will become a Locked Set (LS), and <b>ALL</b> of these Locked Sets
preclude the same value/s; hence we can eliminate those value/s, without needing
to know which ALS will become an LS.
<p>
Therefore <r>we can remove <b>{1}</b></r>.
<p>
Here's an explanation from https://www.sudopedia.org/wiki/Solving_Technique
<p>
<i>A Death Blossom consists of a "stem" cell and an Almost Locked Set (or ALS)
foreach of the stem cell's candidates. The ALS associated with a particular
candidate of the stem cell has that value as one of its own candidates, and
within the ALS, every cell that has the value as a candidate can see the stem
cell. The ALSs can't overlap; ie no cell can belong to more than one ALS. Also,
there must be at least one value that is a candidate of every ALS, but is not a
candidate of the stem cell. (1: These are the eliminatable value/s.)</i>
<p>
<i>Once we've found a Death Blossom, if an outside cell that doesn't belong to
one of the ALSes (and isn't the stem cell) can see every cell in each ALS that
has that value as a candidate, and the value isn't a candidate of the stem
cell, then that value can be eliminated from the outside cell.</i>
<p>
(1) The-value/s-to-eliminate must be common to all ALSs in the DeathBlossom and
not a potential value of the stem cell; which makes sense: the main logic is one
of the ALSs becomes an LS, so all ALSs must share that value (not in stem),
precluding it/them from other cell/s seeing all instances in the DeathBlossom.
<p>
It's also worth noting that there's nothing stopping multiple values being
eliminated by a Death Blossom, it's just, unsurprisingly, rarer than rocking
horse s__t.
<p>
NOTE: Sudoku Explainers DeathBlossom implementation examines stems with 2 or
<b>3</b> maybes, because top1465 doesn't have any 4's and DB is slow; but I'm
lead to believe that 4's do exist, so the rest of the code handles them. So if
you are a stickler for correctness you'll change the &lt; 4 to &lt; 5.
I'm (too, on occasion) performance-centric.
