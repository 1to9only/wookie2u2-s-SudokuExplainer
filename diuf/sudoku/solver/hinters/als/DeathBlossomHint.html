Regardless of the correct value of the stem cell {0}, one of these Almost Locked
Sets (ALS) will become a Locked Set (LS), and <b>ALL</b> of these Locked Sets
preclude the same value/s; hence we can eliminate those value/s, without needing
to know which ALS will become an LS.

<u>Explanation</u> from https://www.sudopedia.org/wiki
<p>
A Death Blossom consists of a "stem" cell and an Almost Locked Set (or ALS)
foreach of the stem cell's candidates. The ALS associated with a particular
candidate of the stem cell has that value as one of its own candidates, and
within the ALS, every cell that has the value as a candidate can see the stem
cell. The ALSs can't overlap; ie no cell can belong to more than one ALS. Also,
there must be at least one value that is a candidate of every ALS, but is not a
candidate of the stem cell. (1) This is the eliminatable value.
<p>
Once we've found a Death Blossom, if an outside cell that doesn't belong to one
of the ALSes (and isn't the stem cell) can see every cell in each ALS that has
that value as a candidate, and the value isn't a candidate of the stem cell,
then that value can be eliminated from the outside cell.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
(1) The-value-to-eliminate must be common to all ALSs in the DeathBlossom and
not a potential value of the stem cell; which makes sense: the main logic is
one of the ALSs must become an LS, so all ALSs must share that nonstem-value,
precluding it from external cell/s seeing all instances in the DeathBlossom.
<p>
There's nothing stopping DeathBlossom eliminating multiple values, it's just
rarer than rocking horse s__t. In fact it never happens in top1465; so to the
best of my knowledge, it never ACTUALLY happens; but SE handles multiple anyway,
just in case; but this "feature" is untested (caveat emptor).
<p>
NOTE: SE's DeathBlossom implementation examines stems with 2 or <u><b>3</b></u>
maybes, because DB is slow and top1465 doesn't have any 4's; but I'm lead to
believe that 4's exist, so the code handles them. So if you're a stickler for
correctness go change the &lt; 4 to &lt; 5. I'm (too, on occasion) eficaphilic.
