<h2>{3}HoDoKu Death Blossom</h2>
<pre>
<k>Stem Pink : {0}</k>

ALSs:
{2}

<r>Elims Red : {1}</r>
</pre>
No matter the value of the stem cell {0}, one of the Almost Locked Sets (ALS) 
becomes a Locked Set (LS), and <b>ALL</b> of these Locked Sets preclude the
red/s; therefore we can eliminate the red/s, without needing to know which ALS
becomes an LS.
<p>
Here's an explanation from https://www.sudopedia.org/wiki/Solving_Technique
<p>
<i>
A Death Blossom consists of a "stem" cell and an Almost Locked Set (or ALS) for
each of the stem cell's candidates. The ALS associated with a particular
candidate of the stem cell has that value as one of its own candidates, and
within the ALS, every cell that has the value as a candidate can see the stem
cell. The ALSes can't overlap; i.e., no cell can belong to more than one ALS.
Also, there must be at least one value that is a candidate of every ALS, but
is not a candidate of the stem cell (these are the eliminatable value/s (1)).
</i>
<p>
<i>
Once we've found a Death Blossom, if an outside cell that doesn't belong to one
of the ALSes (and isn't the stem cell) can see every cell in each ALS that has
that value as a candidate, and the value isn't a candidate of the stem cell,
then that value can be eliminated from the outside cell.
</i>
<p>
(1) I've since discovered that the-value-to-eliminate must be common to all
ALSs in the DeathBlossom, and is not a potential value of the stem cell; which
makes sense: the main point is one of the ALSs becomes an LS, so all ALSs
must share that value (not in stem) to preclude it from the other cell/s.
<p>
It's also worth noting that there's nothing stopping multiple values being
eliminated by a Death Blossom, but it's rarer than rocking horse s__t.
