<h2>HoDoKu ALS-XZ Double Linked</h2>
<p>
The two Almost Locked Sets (ALSs):<pre>
 (a) <b1>{0}</b1>
 (b) <b2>{1}</b2>
</pre>
share the Restricted Common Candidate (RCC) X = {2}<br>
and another (non-restricted) common candidate Z = <b>{3}</b>.
<p>
Therefore <r>we can remove <b>{4}</b></r>. 
<p>
<u>Explanation</u>
<p>
Because these two ALSs are double-linked (share two RCC's) both RC values can be
eliminated from any cells which see all instances of that value in both ALS's;
and also for each of the two ALS's, each non-RCC-value of this ALS is locked
into this ALS only, so is eliminated from all other cells (including those in
the other ALS) which see all occurrences of that value in this ALS only, so
double-linked ALS's are bloody cannibals. Read it again. You'll get there.
<p>
These eliminations are in addition to the "normal" z-based eliminations of a 
single-linked ALS-XZ, where z (if any in double-linked) is removed from cells
seeing all occurrences of z in both ALS's.
