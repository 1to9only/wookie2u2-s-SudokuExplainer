<h2>HoDoKu ALS-Wing</h2>
These three Almost Locked Sets are aligned:<pre>
    (a) <b1>{0}</b1>
    (b) <b2>{1}</b2>
    (c) <b3>{2}</b3>
</pre>
Therefore <r>we can remove <b>{3}</b></r>.

<u>Explanation</u>
<p>
The logic is: if <b>z</b> is not in ALS-A, then ALS-A contains <b>x</b> (because
only one digit can be removed from an ALS), hence ALS-B has <b>y</b> so ALS-C
must have <b>z</b>. The other way round works as well, so no matter which way
the cards fall, either ALS-A or ALS-C contains <b>z</b>, eliminating <b>z</b>
from external cells that see all z's in both ALS-A and ALS-C. Pretty fancy.
<p>
The restriction in Restricted Common Candidate is that all instances of the
value in both ALSs see each other (be in the same box, row, or col).<br>
<p>
An ALS-Wing is an ALS-Chain of length 3. ALS-Wings are handled separately
because they are processed differently: primarily in ALS-Chains an RC-value is
excluded from the physical overlap, if any, of the two ALSs, where-as ALS-Wings
still work when the overlap contains the RC-value, so it's allowed.
