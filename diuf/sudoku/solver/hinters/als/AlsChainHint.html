<h2>HoDoKu ALS-Chain</h2>
<p>
The Chain of Almost Locked Sets (ALSs):
<pre>{0}</pre> share the Restricted Common Candidates (RCCs) such that they push
each other along the chain resulting in the z value (<b>{1}</b>) being in either
the first or the last ALS.
<p>
Hence values common to the first and last ALS can be removed from other cells
which see all occurrences of that value in both the first and last ALS.
<p>
Therefore <r>we can remove <b>{4}</b></r>.

<u>Explanation</u>
<p>
The logic is: each pair of ALSs in the chain (A-B, B-C, etc) share a common
restricted (see below) candidate. If an ALS looses one of it's values then it
becomes a Locked Set. An ALS may loose ONLY ONE value because it must retain a
value for each of it's cells, in order for the Sudoku to remain valid.
So when we chain ALSs on there RCCs, we know that each RCC will be in this ALS
or that ALS; so another value in the receiving ALS is "pushed" into the next ALS
in the chain, and so on around the chain; so they all fall-down like dominoes
IN EITHER DIRECTION; so given a "loop" of ALSs meeting back at the first and
last ALS, we can remove all values common to the first and last ALS from any
cells outside of both ALSs which see all occurrences of that value in both of
these two ALSs, including those in the other ALSs in the chain.
<p>
All occurrences of a "restricted" candidate in both ALSs see each other, so that
this value must be one ALS or the other. In ALS-Chains only it also implies that
the value does not appear in the physical overlap, if any, of the two ALSs.
