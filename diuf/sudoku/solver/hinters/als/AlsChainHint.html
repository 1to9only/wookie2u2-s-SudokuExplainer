<h2>HoDoKu ALS-Chain</h2>
This chain of Almost Locked Sets (ALSs) are aligned:
<pre>{0}</pre>They share the Restricted Common Candidates (RCCs), such that each
pushes a value along the chain, so the z value (<b>{1}</b>) must be in either
the first or the last ALS.
<p>
Hence the z-value/s can be removed from other cells that see all occurrences of
that value in both the first and last ALS.
<p>
Therefore <r>we can remove <b>{4}</b></r>.

<u>Explanation</u>
<p>
The logic is: each pair of ALSs in the chain (A-B, B-C, etc) share a common
restricted (see below) candidate. If an ALS looses one of it is values then it
becomes a Locked Set. An ALS may loose ONLY ONE value because it must retain a
value for each of it is cells, in order for the Sudoku to remain valid.
So when we chain ALSs on there RC-values, we know that each RCC will be in this
ALS or that ALS; so another value in the receiving ALS is "pushed" into the next
ALS in the chain, and so on around the chain. They all fall-down like dominoes
IN EITHER DIRECTION; so given a "loop" of ALSs where the last ALS loops back to
the first ALS, we can remove all values common to the first and last ALS from
any cells outside of both ALSs which see all occurrences of that value in both
of these two ALSs, including those in the other ALSs in the chain.
<p>
Basically, try setting any elimination to its value. The puzzle goes invalid
immediately, or very shortly thereafter.
<p>
All occurrences of a "restricted" candidate in both ALSs see each other, so that
this value must be one ALS or the other. In ALS-Chains only it also implies that
the value does not appear in the physical overlap, if any, of the two ALSs.
