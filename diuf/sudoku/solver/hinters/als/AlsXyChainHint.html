  <h2>HoDoKu ALS-XY-Chain</h2>{3}
  <p>
  The Chain of Almost Locked Sets (ALSs):
<pre>{0}</pre> share the Restricted Common Candidates (RCCs) such that they
  "push" each other along the chain resulting in the z value (<b>{1}</b>)
  being in either the first or the last ALS, hence <b>{1}</b> can be eliminated
  from any cell/s which see all <b>{1}</b>'s in both the first and last ALSs.
  <p>
  Therefore <r><b>{1}</b> can be removed from <b>{2}</b></r>. 
  <p>
  The logic of an ALS-XY-Chain is a bit complex. Each pair of ALSs in the chain
  (A and B, B and C, and so on) share a common restricted candidate, and if an
  <b>Almost</b> Locked Set, by definition, looses just one of it's values then
  it becomes a Locked Set, so that when we chain ALSs using there common RC's
  we know that each RC will be in this ALS or that ALS; which means that one
  of the other values in "the recieving ALS" is "pushed" into the next ALS in
  the chain, and so on around the chain; so they all fall-down like dominoes
  IN EITHER DIRECTION; so with a "loop" of ALSs that meet back at the first and
  last ALS, we can remove all values common to the first and last ALS from
  any cells outside of both ALSs which see all occurrences of that value in
  both ALSs. Simples! Not!
