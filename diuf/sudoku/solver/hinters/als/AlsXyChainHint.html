<h2>HoDoKu ALS-Chain</h2>
<p>
The Chain of Almost Locked Sets (ALSs):
<pre>{0}</pre> share the Restricted Common Candidates (RCCs) such that they
"push" each other along the chain resulting in the z value (<b>{1}</b>)
being in either the first or the last ALS.
<p>
Hence values common to the first and last ALS can be removed from other cells
which see all occurrences of that value in both the first and last ALS.
<p>
Therefore <r>we can remove <b>{4}</b></r>. 
<p>
<u>Explanation</u>
<p>
The logic is: each pair of ALSs in the chain (A and B, B and C, and so on) share
a common restricted* candidate, and if an Almost Locked Set, by definition,
looses just one of it's values then it becomes a Locked Set. An ALS may not
loose two values or it goes invalid. So, when we chain ALSs on there RC's, we
know that each RC will be in this ALS or that ALS; so another value in "the
receiving ALS" is "pushed" into the next ALS in the chain, and so on around the
chain; so they fall-down like dominoes IN EITHER DIRECTION; so with a "loop" of
ALSs that meet back at the first and last ALS, we can remove all values common
to the first and last ALS from any cells outside of both ALSs which see all
occurrences of that value in both ALSs. Simples!
<p>
A "restricted" candidate is a value where all occurrences in both ALS's see
each other, so that this value will be one ALS or the other, and in ALS chains
only it implies that the value does not appear in the physical overlap, if any,
of the two ALS's.
