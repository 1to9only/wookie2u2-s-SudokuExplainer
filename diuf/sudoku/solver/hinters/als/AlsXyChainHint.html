<h2>HoDoKu ALS-Chain</h2>
<p>
The Chain of Almost Locked Sets (ALSs):
<pre>{0}</pre> share the Restricted Common Candidates (RCCs) such that they
"push" each other along the chain resulting in the z value (<b>{1}</b>)
being in either the first or the last ALS.
<p>
Hence values common to the first and last ALS can be removed from other cells
which see all occurrences of that value in both the first and last ALS.
<p>
Therefore <r>we can remove <b>{4}</b></r>. 
<p>
<u>Explanation</u>
<p>
The logic of an ALS-Chain is pretty complex. Each pair of ALSs in the chain
(A and B, B and C, and so on) share a common restricted* candidate, and if an
Almost Locked Set, by definition, looses just one of it's values then it's a
Locked Set, and an ALS may not loose two values or it goes invalid, so that when
we chain ALSs on there RC's we know that each RC will be in this ALS or that ALS;
so another value in "the receiving ALS" is "pushed" into the next ALS in the
chain, and so on around the chain; so they fall-down like dominoes IN EITHER
DIRECTION; so with a "loop" of ALSs that meet back at the first and last ALS,
we can remove all values common to the first and last ALS from any cells outside
of both ALSs which see all occurrences of that value in both ALSs. Simples!
<p>
A "restricted" candidate is a value where all occurrences in both ALS's see each
other, and in ALS chains it also means the value does not appear in the overlap,
if any, of the two ALS's.
