I'm sorry, I don't understand Sue De Coq.
<p>
Here's an explanation by hobiwan from HoDoKu's website at
http://hodoku.sourceforge.net/en/tech_misc.php
<p>
The basic variant is rather simple: Look for cells at the intersection of a
line (a row or a col) and a block. You have to find either two cells containing
4 candidates or three cells containing 5 candidates. Now find a bivalue cell in
the line outside of the intersection whose candidates are draw entirely from
the intersection candidates. Find another bivalue cell in the block with
candidates drawn from the intersection too, but different from the candidates
in the line cell.
<p>
This constellation is a Sue de Coq: You can eliminate all line cell candidates
from the rest of the cells in the line, all block cell candidates from the rest
of the cells in the block and any intersection candidate that is left from both
the line and the block. This can amount in some rather impressive eliminations.
<p>
Sue de Coq can be enhanced in two possible ways:<ul>
<li>The intersection cells can contain additional candidates. For each extra 
    candidate an extra cell in the line or in the block must be found.
<li>The line cells and the block cells can contain candidates not drawn from
    the intersection set. For any such additional candidate one additional cell
    is necessary.
</ul>
It's important to note, that an SDC can have only two cells in the intersection
with the possible third cell being part of either the line or the block cells.
Likewise, if additional candidates are used, that are not drawn from the
intersection set, the same candidate can be used in line cells and block cells.
