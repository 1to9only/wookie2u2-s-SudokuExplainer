NOTE: ALS (Almost Locked Sets) is based on HoDoKu code by Bernhard Hobiger.

SueDeCoq is from MiscellaneousSolver. It's a two-or-three digit pattern
reminiscent of ALS's, so it sort-of-fits here.

ALS means Almost Locked Sets
============================

2020-09-23 renamed alshdk package diuf.sudoku.solver.hinters.als because
           it's HoDoKu origin doesn't seem so important any longer.

While many of the hint-types in DIUF are inspired by HoDoKu, I outright stole
the ALS implementation code from HoDoKu after having a go at it myself (four
times now) and failing miserably.

1. Hdk types: are (mostly) boosted from HoDoKu. By mostly I mean that some
   additional fields and some translator code has been added; and some HoDoKu
   code (esp groupedBuddies) has been imported into these classes to remove
   there dependencies on HoDoKu's large web of classes.

2. Diuf types: are native to DIUF Sudoku Explainer (this project).

3. If neither it's probably "boosted clean" out of HoDoKu, with no dependency
   on the HoDoKu types... but you never know, so "unspecified" is probably the
   best definition.

So internally I'm all HoDoKu, but externally I'm all DIUF Sudoku Explainer.

Compare and contrast HoDoKu and Sudoku Explainer
================================================

Some equivalences exist between HoDoKu (hdk) and Sudoku Explainer (SE). In the
following text the hdk name is always given first, then the SE name.

Hdks SudokuStepFinder is roughly equivalent to SE's LogicalSolver in that it
exists to be an interface to all the solver/hinter classes. In hdk a step in
solving the puzzle is called a SolutionStep or "step" and in SE's it a AHint
or plain "hint". Classes that produce steps/hints are called Solver/Hinters.

Sudoku Explainer is MUCH more "region focused" than HoDoKu, I suppose because
the regions are designed and coded early in the development process they take
on an importance which they do not necessarily deserve in my thinking about
Sudoku problems. Regardless of why, Sudoku Explainer almost always attributes
a hint to region/s which own or atleast contribute to a hint; and the regions
are displayed in all hints where they're relevant. HoDoKu doesn't display
regions in it's hints, at all. So most of the thinking isn't so "regional".

Sudoku Explainer attempts to provide the user with a human readable explanation
(example) and justification of (logic behind) every hint. HoDoKu just gives
the user a hard-to-read string which defines but does not explain or justify
the hint, so a user can't use HoDoKu to learn how to solve Sudokus themselves;
which is what I think the real challenge is, or atleast should be. We pay it
forward. That's the open source ethos. Because it works.

HoDoKu has gone all-out to remove statefulness from Sudoku solving by stashing
everything possible in static arrays; and calling "get" methods to fetch cell
attributes from the sudoku (Sudoku2) instance. Sudoku Explainer is a lot more
laid-back in it's design, it's Grid contains all state in attributes which are
accessed directly (many times not through any method). SE's raw attributes are
much faster but (I guess) you run into problems when you take Sudoku solving
to lengths that hobiwan has gone to. Be in no doubt that hobiwans algorithms
are "more advanced" (hobiwans algorithms are researched, mine are just mine and
Nicolas Juillerat's) it's just that, mainly thanks to my "everything at hand"
model Sudoku Explainer is actually faster despite (or maybe because of?) using 
"less intelligent" and therefore "harder work" algorithms. Simpler is faster,
even when it's actually more work. Go figure.

SE still relies heavily on it's super-fact Chainers. But it's now adopted many
of HoDoKu's "mid range" solving techniques to hopefully provide a much better
answer to the question:

    How can any Sudoku puzzle be solved as simply and quickly as possible?

PS: DIUF Sudoku Explainer's hodoku package relies on HoDoKu (slightly modified)
which is now linked-in as a library. But not alshdk: here I boosted just the
required code out of HoDoKu, and put it in Sudoku Explainer. Adopting the whole
damn project came later when I hit "complex" Fish; banged my head repeatedly on
an unyielding wall; gave up, and just used what was in front of me instead of
insisting on "boosting" everything (adapting hobiwans algorithms to my model).
