  <h2>HoDoKu ALS-XY-Wing</h2>
<pre>The three Almost Locked Sets:
  ALS A: <b1>{0}</b1>
  ALS B: <b2>{1}</b2>
  ALS C: <b3>{2}</b3>
share the common values x, y and z such that:
        <tt><b>z</b>- A -<b>x</b>- C -<b>y</b>- B -<b>z</b></tt>
which means:
  ALSs A and C share the restricted common (RC) value <b>x = {4}</b>,
  ALSs C and B share the restricted common (RC) value <b>y = {5}</b>,
  ALSs A and B share the unrestricted common value/s <b>z = {6}</b>
</pre>
  Therefore <r>{3}</r>. 
  <p>
  The logic is: if <b>z</b> is not in ALS A, then ALS A contains <b>x</b>
  because only one digit may miss from an ALS. That means that ALS C must
  contain <b>y</b> (x is missing from C) and thus ALS B must contain <b>z</b>
  (y is missing from B). The other way round works as well: If ALS B does not
  contain <b>z</b> then ALS A must. Hence <b>z</b> can be removed from all
  other cells which see all z's in both ALS A and ALS B.
  <p>
  Note that <b>x</b> and <b>y</b> may not be the same digit.
  <p>
  The restriction in Restricted Common Candidate is that all instances of the
  value in both ALSs must be siblings (ie all "see" each other).<br>
  <p>
  Note that an ALS-XY-Wing is an ALS-Chain of length 3.
  ALS-XY-Wing's are handled separately because in ALS-Chain only RC's may not
  appear in the overlap (common cells) of the two ALSs, if any.
