<h2>VWXYZ-Wing {12}{10}{11}</h2>
<p>
    The five cells <c><b>{0}</b>, <b>{1}</b>, <b>{2}</b>, <b>{3}</b></c> and <k><b>{4}</b></k>
    form a <b>VWXYZ-Wing</b>:
    The four cells <b>{0}</b>, <b>{1}</b>, <b>{2}</b> and <b>{3}</b>
    form an almost locked set (ALS) linked to the bivalue cell <b>{4}</b>
    through the value <b>{9}</b>. 
    If the value <b>{5}</b> was eliminated from the four ALS cells then
    the remaining value <b>{9}</b> in cell <b>{4}</b> forces the four ALS
    cells to share only three possible candidates, which is absurd!
</p>
<p>
    The <b>value {5}</b> can therefore be removed from any cells which see
    all {5}'s in our four wing cells AND the bivalue cell {4}.
</p>
<p>
    The largest cell of the wing has atmost 5 candidates and the 4 cells in
    the ALS (almost locked set) have a total of 5 candidates.
