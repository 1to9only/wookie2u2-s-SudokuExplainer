<h2>VWXYZ-Ring {12}{10}{11}</h2>
<p>
    The five cells <c><b>{0}</b>, <b>{1}</b>, <b>{2}</b>, <b>{3}</b></c> and <k><b>{4}</b></k>
    form a <i>double-linked</i> <b>VWXYZ-Wing</b> called a Ring:
    The four cells <b>{0}</b>, <b>{1}</b>, <b>{2}</b> and <b>{3}</b> form
    an almost locked set linked to the bivalue cell <b>{4}</b> through
    <i>both</i> values <b>{5}</b> and <b>{9}</b> therefore creating a
    loop/ring. Regardless of the final value of cell <b>{4}</b>, the
    double-link forces the four wing cells to have different values to {4},
    so all 5 values are locked into these 5 cells, ie it's a locked set.
</p>
<p>
    <b><u>Other occurrences of any of the values</u></b> of the Ring
    pattern can therefore be removed from any cells sharing a box, row, or
    col with all Ring cells containing that value.
</p>
<p>
    The largest cell of the Ring has atmost 5 candidates and all 4 cells of
    the ALS have a total of 5 candidates, hence this pattern is similar to
    a 5digit-5cell Sue de Coq (SDC), presuming there is such a thing. sigh.
