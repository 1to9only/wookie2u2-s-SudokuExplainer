<h2>Sukaku {11}</h2>
<p>
The {7} cells <c><b>{0}</b></c> and <k><b>{2}</b></k>
form a <b>double-linked Wing</b>, called a Ring.
<p>
The {8} cells <b>{1}</b> are an Almost Locked Set (ALS)
that is <b>double-linked</b> to the bivalue cell <b>{2}</b>
through <b>both</b> values <b>{4}</b> and <b>{3}</b> to create a ring/loop.
Regardless of the value of <b>{2}</b>, the double-link forces the {8} ALS cells
to have a different value to <b>{2}</b>, so these {7} values are "locked into"
these {7} cells, ergo it's a Locked Set.
<p>
Hence <b>all</b> of the Rings values can be removed from other cells which see
all occurrences of that value in the Ring.
<p>
Therefore <r>we can remove <b>{5}</b></r>.
