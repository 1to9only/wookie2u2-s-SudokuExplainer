<h2>Sukaku {11}</h2>
<p>
The {7} cells <c><b>{0}</b></c> and <b1><b>{2}</b></b1>
form a <b>double-linked Wing</b>, called a Ring.
<p>
The {8} cells <b>{1}</b> are an Almost Locked Set (ALS)
that is <b>double-linked</b> to the <b1><b>bivalue cell {2}</b></b1>
through <b>both</b> values <g><b>{4}</b></g> and <g><b>{3}</b></g> to create a
ring/loop. Regardless of the value of <b1><b>{2}</b></b1>, the double-link
forces the {8} ALS cells to have a different value to <b1><b>{2}</b></b1>, so
ALL of these {7} values are "locked into" these {7} cells, ergo the Ring is a
Locked Set.
<p>
Hence <u>all</u> of the Rings values can be eliminated from external cells
which see all occurrences of that value in the Ring.
<p>
Therefore <r>we can remove <b>{5}</b></r>.
