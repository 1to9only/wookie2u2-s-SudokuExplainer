<h2>Sukaku {10}</h2>
<p>
The {7} cells <c><b>{0}</b></c> and <k><b>{2}</b></k> form a <b>{10}</b>.
<p>
The {8} cells <b>{1}</b>
are an Almost Locked Set (ALS) that is linked to the bivalue cell <b>{2}</b>
through the value <b>{4}</b>,
so if the value <b>{3}</b>
was eliminated from all {7}
Wing cells then the remaining value <b>{3}</b> of <b>{2}</b>
leaves just {9} values to fill the {8} ALS cells, which is invalid;
so <b>{4}</b> is "locked into" these {7} Wing cells, hence <b>{3}</b>
can be removed from cells which see all <b>{3}</b>'s in the Wing.
<p>
Therefore <r>we can remove <b>{5}</b></r>.
