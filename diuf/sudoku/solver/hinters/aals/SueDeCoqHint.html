I am sorry, I do not understand Sue De Coq, so I cannot explain this hint.
<p>
Here's hobiwans explanation http://hodoku.sourceforge.net/en/tech_misc.php
<p>
The basic variant is rather simple: Look for cells at the intersection of a
line (a row or a col) and a box. You have to find either two cells containing
4 candidates or three cells containing 5 candidates. Now find a bivalue cell in
the line outside of the intersection whose candidates are drawn entirely from
the intersection candidates. Find another bivalue cell in the box with
candidates drawn from the intersection too, but different from the candidates
in the line cell.
<p>
This constellation is a Sue de Coq: You can eliminate all line cell candidates
from the rest of the cells in the line, all box cell candidates from the rest
of the cells in the box and any intersection candidate that is left from both
the line and the box. This can amount in some rather impressive eliminations.
<p>
Sue de Coq can be enhanced in two possible ways:<ul>
<li>The intersection cells can contain additional candidates. For each extra
    candidate an extra cell in the line or in the box must be found.
<li>The line cells and the box cells can contain candidates not drawn from
    the intersection set. For any such additional candidate one additional cell
    is necessary.
</ul>
It is important to note, that an SDC can have only two cells in the intersection
with the possible third cell being part of either the line or the box cells.
Likewise, if additional candidates are used, that are not drawn from the
intersection set, the same candidate can be used in line cells and box cells.
