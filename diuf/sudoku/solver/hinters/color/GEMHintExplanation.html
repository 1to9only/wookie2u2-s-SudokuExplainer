<u>Explanation</u>
GEM (Graded Equivalence Marks) is the "ultimate" coloring technique.

This is an explanation of how GEM paints cell-values and uses those to produce
contradiction and elimination hints. I wrote this because the GEM specification
is confusing.

GEM paints two sets of cell-values in two colors: GREEN and BLUE.

Our first task is to find the value that has at least 2 conjugate relationships
(ie there are two places for this value in at least 2 regions) and is in the
most bivalue cells (one of two potential values of a cell). We keep score for
each value: a conjugate pair is 1 point, and a bivalue cell is 1 point.

This implementation searches values with a total score of 4 or more, because 4
is the min score that produces a hint in top1465, but there's nothing magical
about top1465, so 4 may be too high for some Sudoku puzzles. An expert could get
this right. I'm just a computer programmer, so I'm doing what works for me, in
the hope that it works for others. Experts have facts. Pragmatists have hope.
Hence expert pragmatists are ____ed, but at least we know that we're ____ed, and
so are cheerfully up-front about it, in the hope that a real expert will provide
empirical support, or repudiate the contention. Lower or remove this constraint
to suit your requirements. It's only for speed.

So we start with a value that has two possible positions in a region. We paint
the first position GREEN, so the second will be BLUE.

It's important to get your head around the "strong" bidirectionality of this
and indeed all coloring relationships:
                If cell A is value     then cell B is NOT value,
<b>and conversely</b>, If cell B is NOT value then cell A is value.
Every painted cell-value has a "strong" (bidirectional) relationship with every
other painted cell-value, so it's one in, all in; and one out, all out; and ONE
of the two colors MUST be true. Ergo assert green XOR blue. Got it?

We look at the three regions containing each cell we paint (it's box, row, and
col). If this region also has two possible locations for this value then paint
this value of the other cell the other color.

If a cell has two potential values then paint the other value the other color.

When each cell-value is painted we also "off" (rendered as a '-' to the right
of the digit) each other occurrence of this value in each of this cells three
regions, and each other potential value of this cell. The "off"s are used later.

Thus we paint all the consequences of painting each cell-value, recursively.

paintMonoBoxs: paint a HiddenSingle in a box effected by (2 boxs left/right,
and 2 boxs above/below) each painted cell-value.
Shoot back (a KRC original): if this cell-value also leaves a HiddenSingle in
the source box then paint it this color: a "strong" bidirectional relationship;
else it is just an "on": a "weak" unidirectional relationship. If blue turns out
to be true then we set this cell to this value, but setting this cell to this
value implies absolutely nothing about the verity of blue; ergo there is no "and
conversely" with an "on", it's JUST an "on".

paintPromotions:
* When all but one cell mates or siblings of a cell-value are "off"ed by this
  color, the survivor is an "on" of this color.
  - If all bar one value is "off"ed from a cell (this color) then "on" it.
  - If all bar one place is "off"ed in a region (same value, this color) then
    "on" it.
* An "on" seeing/with the opposite color is painted it's own color.
  - If an "on" has an opposite colored cell-mate (any value) then paint it.
  - If an "on" sees the opposite color (same value) then paint it.
* Shoot back (a KRC original): if an "on" leaves ONE v of this color in any box
  then paint the on; as per paintMonoBoxs but here we start from the effect, for
  which we seek a cause.
  - This finds occurrences that paintMonoBoxs doesn't. When looking at the extra
    finds, one sees paints where the "cause" has no DIRECT link to the "effect".
    Colored cells of this value gang-up to leave a HiddenSingle in the effected
    box, which "causes" a HiddenSingle in a box, so yes there's a strong link,
    but WTF: Why does paintMonoBoxs find occurrences that this rule misses?

We keep doing paintMonoBoxs and paintPromotions as long as either of them finds
something to paint full-colors ("ons" don't count).

Then we look for "contradictions" (big hints which set cell values):
* If there's two green/ons with different values in one cell then blue is true.
* If there's two green/ons with the same value in a region then blue is true.
* If green off's all of a cells values then blue is true.
* If all v's in a region see green v's then blue is true.
* And vice-versa from blue to green, obviously. I'm just being terse.
* When a contradiction hint is found then stop searching for other hints.
* "blue is true" means all cell-values (including "ons") rendered in a larger
  blue font are set when this hint is applied.

Then we look for "eliminations" (little hints that eliminate cell values):
* If a cell has values of both colors then eliminate all other potential values.
* If an uncolored v sees both colored v's then eliminate it.
* If an uncolored v sees green and has some other blue value then eliminate it.
* If both colors "off" the same cell-value then eliminate it. This rule covers
  both previous rules (and more besides) which still exist to provide specific
  explanations; this rule exists as a catch all.
* Eliminations are rendered as a RED '-' in the GUI, and if that's added to the
  actual eliminations (the redPots) then the value is also RED; but if the cell
  value is set then the elimination is automatic. It's a tad more complex than
  it really needs to be, but it shows exactly what's happening.

Then (if there's any eliminations) we look for "confirmations":
* If all bar one value is actually eliminated from a cell and the remaining
  cell-value is colored then that whole color is true.
* If all but one occurrence of a value is actually eliminated from a region
  and the remaining cell-value is colored then that whole color is true.
* Note that both of these rules use the actual eliminations (the redPots).
* "color is true" means all cell-values (including "ons") rendered in a larger
  this-color font will be set when this hint is applied.

Then we set consequent naked/hidden singles (currently disabled).
* for contradictions and confirmations we start from the given setPots. For an
  eliminations hint we see if eliminations leave any naked or hidden singles,
  and produce a setPots of them (else it's just a "normal" eliminations hint).
* setPots are set in the grid, using autosolve so that any consequent naked or
  hidden singles are also set, recursively.
  - NakedSingle: If a cell has one potential value then set it to that value.
  - HiddenSingle: If value has one place in a region then set it to the value.
* Eliminations: we use all the reasonably fast hinters (upto 20ms/elim) to
  eliminate maybes from the grid in the hunt for more singles.
* Consequent singles make GEM more likely to solve the puzzle, because I just
  hate it when a few cells are left-out in the cold, so GEM chases them down,
  but it does so silently: no justification is provided for consequent singles.
  If you demur then set CONSEQUENT_SINGLES and CONSEQUENT_SINGLES_TOO = false
  in GEM.java. It's perfectly sane and reasonable to demur. I'm just greedy.
  If you want a complete explanation of all hints then switch this crap off.

And then we go for a little lie down.

<u>GUI Rendering</u>
* '+' means "on": a '+' next to a digit in the Grid means this is an "on".
  If this color is true then this cell is set to this value; but an "on" isn't
  a "full" colored cell-value, used in logic; it's JUST an extra value to set.
* One exception: contradictions use ons: an "on" is treated the same as a full
  colored cell-value when repudiating a colors validity. If an "on" is proven
  invalid then it's whole color is invalid, hence the other color must be true.
  One out, all out. This is pretty hard to get your head around. Read it again.
* '-' means "off": a '-' next to a digit in the Grid means this is an "off".
  If this color is true then value is eliminated from cell. If both colors "off"
  the same cell-value then it can be eliminated, so it's painted red.
* A red <r>-</r> means this cell-value CAN be eliminated. A red <r>digit</r> means that it
  WILL be eliminated when this hint is applied. Cell-values do not need to be
  eliminated explicitly when the cell is set, it happens automatically.
* The GREEN/BLUE digit in a larger font renders the value to set this cell to.

<u>Unfinished GEM</u>
My GEM is an incomplete implementation of the specification in #GEM.txt because
I'm too stupid to understand the spec, so I'm ignoring the ____ out of it, and
implementing what makes sense to me. Of course it's possible that I have blindly
completely implemented the spec, but I don't think it's likely. To be clear, I
find the spec confusing (gibberish in places), and it's demonstrably WRONG on
one point, which erodes ones confidence. ~KRC 2021-05-21.
