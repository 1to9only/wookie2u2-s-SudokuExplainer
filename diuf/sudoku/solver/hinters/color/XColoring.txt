X-Colors (Extended Colors)
##########################

X-Colors, or eXtended Colors, is a coloring technique that uses only 2 colors,
even when weak links are bridged. It is a relatively simple method that can be
learned quickly and is capable of achieving the same results as more advanced
techniques, such as Multi-Colors and single-digit chains.

This technique can be used on an initial color cluster of any size, although a
larger cluster increases the chances of finding candidates to remove.

X-Colors can be seen as an extension of the Weak Colors technique. Both Weak
Colors and X-Colors are based on a simple set of instructions, which must be
executed repeatedly.

Occasionally, X-Colors can go as far as Nishio, the ultimate single-digit
solving technique. This puts X-Color in positive territory, since many
solvers like to avoid Nishio.

X-Colors does the same job as both Simple Colors and Multi-Colors with only two
colors and a few simple steps, defined in an algorithmic way, and solves more
situations than both can. However, X-Colors does not replace the multiple
digit Ultracoloring technique. See the examples below to better understand the
technique.

    3 Augmenting X-Colors with Single-Digit Techniques

Algorithm
=========

X-Colors is a single-digit technique so we focus on a single candidate in the
grid, called the Coloring Value, or coloqually just v.

Coloring encodes the binary nature of conjugate pairs by placing one conjugate
in one color-set and the other conjugate in the other color-set; it doesn't
matter which color-set you put the first conjugate in, all that matters is that
ALL subsequent colorings are a consequence of the initial assumption.
I belabour this point because I have just struck a reef: I added multiple
INITIAL assumptions to a single color-set and therefore producing invalid
hints. My bad! I'm a dill.

Step 1: Select a conjugate pair (the only two positions for v in a region),
     color one of them with colorA and the other with colorB.
     nb: In SE colorA is painted green, and colorB is blue.

Step 2: do following until no more new cells are colored
 2.1 Find a uncolored cell that conjugates with an already colored cell
     (either color A or B, it matters not).
 2.2 Color this new cell with the OPPOSITE color of its conjugate.
     That is, if the cell is ColorA then its conjugate cell is ColorB.
     This is how coloring encodes the binary nature of conjugate pairs.

Step 3: Until no more new cells can be found to be colored, do:
 3.1 If all but one-and-only-one cell (called the Exception Cell) of all
     v's in a region see cells of the same color (say colorA) then the
     Exception cell is colored with the SAME color (colorA).

Step 4: Once all possible cells in the puzzle are marked Color A or B:
 4.1 If a cell sees both colored cells (A AND B),
     then exclude v from this cell.
 4.2 If 2+ cells in a region are the same color,
     then the OTHER color is true.
 4.3 If ALL cells in a region see cells of the same color,
     then the OTHER color is true.

That's the whole coloring technique. At the end of Step 3, we have three
disjunct sets of cells: colorA, colorB, and those remaining uncolored.

Hence we find these true/false implications:
 * If one cell colored A is true, then the whole set of cells colored A are true.
 * If one cell colored A is false, then the whole set of cells colored with the
   OPPOSITE Color B are true.
 * If you can't prove any of the prior then try other techniques.

Please note that these two assertions DO NOT IMPLY that if A is true, then B is
False, and vice versa. This "ying-yang" sentence is only true when dealing
exclusively with conjugate pairs of cells, and, in that case, trueing cells
colored A will immediately eliminate candidates in peer cells, including those
colored B, so the distinction is irrelevant.

Important things to pay attention to:
  * If we eliminate Step 3 what's left is Simple Coloring. It's Step 3 that
    makes the difference. Its very powerful.
  * During Step 3, if you color A one cell that has a pair-conjugated cell that
    has not been colored A or B until then, YOU CANNOT COLOR THIS UNCOLORED
    CELL WITH THE OPPOSITE COLOR. That's steps 1 and 2, but NOT step 3.
  * Steps 1, 2, 3, 4 are done IN SEQUENCE; you can't go back from step 3 to 2,
    just for instance.
  * Case 4.3 is rare. It happens when there's no Exception Cell in a region.
  * X-Colors solves every position solved by both Single and Multiple Coloring
    techniques, but it also finds hints where neither of them will. And it uses
    only two colors, which makes it easy to understand and use by humans.
  * X-Colors finds all X-Wings; in fact, Multiple Colors mostly does that too.
    So if you want X-Colors, you should unwant X-Wing coz it won't hint.
    Unfortunately, this is not true with the rest of Fishing techniques.

Examples
========

These examples show all situations defined above, except Single Colors.
X-Colors is a superset of Single Colors, so Single examples aren't required.

In these examples, the blue and green lines help us follow Step 3's coloring
implications: marking all cells in a region affected by a colored cell.

Example 1
---------

Multicolors: same hint as Multiple Colors technique.

XCEx1.png

Focusing on 2, we mark the conjugate pair r9c2 (blue) and r9c8 (green).
(Cells marked with 1). Step 2 does not mark any more cells.

Step 3 allows us to mark r2c1 Blue (Cell marked with 2), because it's the only
cell in its box that is not a peer of r9c2. No more cells are marked in Step 3.

Step 4.1 removes 2 from r2c8 (Cell marked with X), because it is peer both of
r2c1 (blue) and r9c8 (green).

Example 2
---------

Elimination not found by Single or Multiple Colors.

XCEx2.png

Focusing on 6, we mark the conjugate pair r1c4 (blue) and r2c5 (green).

Step 2 allows us to mark r4c4 green. (All these cells are marked with 1).

Step 3 allows in the first iteration to mark (Cells marked with 2):
  * r9c6 green because it's the only cell which maybe 6 in it's box that isn't
    a peer of r2c5. Alternately r9c6 green coz only cell in col that !sees r4c4
  * r5c8 green because it's the only cell which maybe 6 in it's box that isn't
    a peer of r4c4. Alternately r5c8 green coz only cell in row that !sees r4c4

Step 3, second iteration, allows us now to mark r1c7 green (Cell marked with 3)
because it's the only cell in its box which maybe 6 that is not a peer of green
cells (r2c5 and r5c8 are peers of the rest of the cells of the box).

NOTE: We can mark more cells in subsequent iterations of Step 3 (r3c1 green,
then r8c3 green) but the results are the same, so are not shown.

Step 4.1 removes 6 from r1c1 and r1c3 (Cells marked with X) because these cells
are peers both of r1c4 (blue) and r1c7 (green).

Example 3
---------

Both elimination of candidates and contradiction, found in the same puzzle.

XCEx3.png

In a similar way as Example 2, and you can easily find the way to exclude the
cells marked with X (r2c7 and r2c9), as they share as peer a green cell (r1c8
in its box) and a blue cell (r2c3 in its row).

BUT also you can see that r1c8 (already marked green) is the only cell in its
box which is not a peer of r2c3, so, as Step 3 states, you can mark it BLUE.
The result is a contradiction (a cell marked simultaneously green and blue) and
two cells in a row (r1) and in a column (c8) with the same color (blue).

Then, as Step 4.2 states, the cells marked green are TRUE. You can immediately
solve all the green cells (r1c8, r7c2 and r9c5) because all of them are an 8.
Note that, even if you have found a contradiction with blue cells, you CANNOT
assume that ALL BLUE CELLS ARE FALSE. You can only conclude in that situation
that GREEN CELLS ARE TRUE.

Example 4
---------

Elimination after multiple iterations of Step 3.

XCEx4.png

This is an example of how several iterations of Step 3 can find eliminations.
In this position, focusing on 5, there is only one conjugate pair:
r5c6 and r7c6 (Cells marked with 1).

After Step 2, no more cells can be marked. Single Colors and Multiple Colors
are useless here.

Performing multiple iterations of Step 3, we mark green various cells, one cell
each iteration, marked with numbers 2 to 5. When Step 3 cannot mark any more
cells, we exclude 5 from cells marked X (Step 4.1)

Example 5
---------

Contradiction.

XCEx5.png

After Step 1 and 2 we have colored cells marked 1.

Step 3 colors (blue) two cells of col 9 (r2c9, r7c9). That's a contradiction,
so Step 4.2 concludes that Green cells (r8c6) are true. Once again, Green Cells
are true does NOT imply Blue Cells are false! (Some blues may still be true).

Example 6
---------

Contradiction, and No cells left in one house to be colored with one color.

This hint is also found with Multicolors, but X-Colors also addresses the rare
use-case in which a region doesn't hold any cell of a given color (Step 4.3).

XCEx6.png

Focusing on 1, and after initial Coloring (Cells marked 1), and even before
applying Step 3, you can see that all cells in the lower-left box which maybe 1
are peers of green cells.

No one cell can then be marked green in this box, so, as Step 4.3 states, you
can conclude that BLUE CELLS ARE TRUE, ie they must contain a 1.

Augmenting X-Colors with Single-Digit Buttplugs
===============================================

The X-Colors technique can be further augmented with single-digit techniques
for faster or further eliminations. The following example shows how we can
replicate Empty Rectangle using X-Colors plus Pointing Pair:

XColorsER.png

After the initial coloring for digit 8, r5c3 cannot be colored blue so either
r4c1 or r6c1 can be colored blue, although we don't know which one. But we do
get a "Pointing Pair" in the fourth box due to these two cells. Since r3c1 is
pointed to by these cells and r3c1 also sees a green cell, we can eliminate 8
from r3c1. 

This shows how to replicate Empty Rectangle with X-Colors with Pointing Pair.
In the example the elimination can be made after four iterations of Step 3,
but using Pointing Pair reduces this to two iterations.

We can also conceive of X-Colors augmented with other single-digit techniques
such as Swordfish, Jellyfish, etc but NOT with X-Wing, due to the fact that
X-Colors makes the same eliminations as X-Wing. In fact Multi-Colors covers
X-Wing, and X-Colors covers Multi-Colors.

So bring out the gimp! Or at least wewease Wodderwick.
