<u>GUI Rendering</u>
* '+' means "on": a '+' next to a digit in the Grid means this is an "on".
  If this color is true then this cell is set to this value; but an "on" isn't
  a "full" colored cell-value, used in logic; it's JUST an extra value to set.
* '-' means "off": a '-' next to a digit in the Grid means this is an "off".
  If this color is true then value is eliminated from cell. If both colors "off"
  the same cell-value then it can be eliminated, so it's painted red.
* A <r>red -</r> means this cell-value CAN be eliminated. A <r>red digit</r> means that it
  WILL be eliminated when the hint is applied. The value does not need to be
  eliminated separately when this cells value is set.
* The GREEN/BLUE digit in a larger font renders the value to set this cell to.

<u>Explanation</u>
GEM is the "ultimate" coloring technique. Coloring has two sets of cell values
painted in two colors: GREEN and BLUE.

We start with a value that has two possible positions in a region. We paint the
first position GREEN (so the second will be BLUE). 

We look at the three regions containing each cell we paint (it's box, row, and
col). If this region also has two possible locations for this value then we
paint the other cell the other color.

If a cell has two possible values we can paint the other value the other color.

When each cell value is painted we also "off" (rendered as a '-' next to it's
digit) each other occurrence of this value in each of this cells three regions.
These "off"s are used later in eliminations.

Thus we recursively paint all consequences of painting each cell-value.

paintMonoBoxs: a Hidden Single in a box that's effected by (2 boxs left/right,
and 2 boxs above/below) the painted cell-value.
Shoot back: if this cell-value also leaves a Hidden Single in the source box
then we paint it this color: a bidirectional relationship, a "strong" link;
else it is just an "on": a unidirectional relationship, a "weak" link.

paintPromotions:
* When all but one cell mates or siblings of a colored cell-value are "off"ed,
  the survivor is an "on" of that color.
  - If all bar one value is "off"ed from a cell (one color) then "on" it.
  - If all bar one place is "off"ed from a region (same value, one color) then
    "on" it.
* An "on" seeing/with opposite color is painted it's own color.
  - If an "on" sees the opposite color (same value) then paint it.
  - If an "on" has an opposite colored cell-mate (any value) then paint it.

We keep doing paintMonoBoxs and paintPromotions as long as either of them finds
something to paint full-colors ("ons" don't count).

Then we look for "contradictions":
* If there's two greens (same value) in a region then blue is true.
* If there's two green values in a cell then blue is true.
* If there's two green "on"s (same value) in a region then blue is true.
* If there's two green "on"s in a cell then blue is true.
* And conversely from blue to green, obviously. I'm just being terse.
* Note that when a contradiction is found we stop searching for more hints.
* "blue is true" means all cell-values rendered in a larger blue font will be
  set when this hint is applied. This includes full-colors and "ons".

Then we look for "eliminations":
* Both colors appear in a single tri+valued cell, eliminating all other values.
* An uncolored candidate X sees two differently colored X, eliminating it.
* An uncolored candidate X sees a green, but this cell has another blue value,
  eliminating X.
* If both colors have an "off" for the same cell-value then eliminate it.
* Eliminations are rendered as a RED '-' in the GUI, and if that's added to the
  actual eliminations (the redPots) then the value is also RED; but if this cell
  value is to be set then the elimination doesn't need to happen. It's a tad
  more complex than it needs to be, but it shows exactly where we're at.

Then (if there's any eliminations) we look for "confirmations":
* If all bar one value is eliminated from a cell, and the remaining cell-value
  is colored then that whole color is true.
* When all but one occurrence of a value is eliminated from a region and the
  remaining cell-value is colored then that whole color is true.
* Note that both of these rules use the actual eliminations (the redPots).
* Note that when a confirmation is found we stop searching for more hints.
* "color is true" means all cell-values rendered in a larger blue font will be
  set when this hint is applied. This includes full-colors and "ons".

And then we go for a little lie down.
