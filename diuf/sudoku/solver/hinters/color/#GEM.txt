GEM (Graded Equivalence Marks) is the ultimate coloring technique.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
KRC's notes appear between two lines of tildes, like this.

Note that the author ascribes offs to the other color, which hurts my brain,
so I ascribe offs to this color. He also specifies a couple of elimination tests
that are just jibberish, I think because my brain refuses to mis-ascribe offs.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First we segway into Subset Exclusion, whose concepts are used in GEM.

The name Subset Exclusion is not commonly used in the Sudoku community.
This article is created as a bridge between Aligned Pair Exclusion and Death
Blossom.

Aligned Pair Exclusion can be extended to Aligned Triple Exclusion and so on.
In fact, the set of cells to be enumerated does not need to be aligned at all.
Lacking a better name, let us call the resultant technique Subset Exclusion.

Example

SubsetExclusion.png

We can enumerate the possible combinations of the blue cells as in Aligned Pair
Exclusion. The following list shows the possible combinations, top to bottom:

5+2+4
5+2+6
5+6+4
5+7+4*
5+7+6*
5+9+4*
5+9+6*
7+2+4
7+2+6
7+6+4
7+9+4
7+9+6

The starred combinations are those that causes any of the yellow cells to have
no candidates at all, so these combinations can be removed from the list. As a
result, we find that 7 can be eliminated from r2c4.

===============================================================================

Second we segway to Equivalence Marks, which also contributes concepts to GEM.

People solving Sudokus with pencil and paper cannot use coloring techniques,
unless they find an alternative to coloring cells and/or candidates.
Equivalence Marks are such an alternative.

Since there is little room for elaborate markings in a pencilmark grid, the
marks are very basic. Odd Parity is symbolized by an apostrophe ' and even
parity by a quotation mark ".

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SE: ' (odd) is GREEN (0)
  , " (even) is BLUE (1)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Only coloring techniques that use a single cluster can be replicated, otherwise
more marks are required.

The following techniques can be replicated by Equivalence Marks:

    3D Medusa | Medusa Trap | Medusa Wrap | Advanced Coloring

Marking Rules

Start with a bivalue cell or bilocal digit having other strong links which can
be followed, and mark one candidate n' and the other n". These marks indicate
that these candidates are strongly linked and are therefore mutually exclusive.
From this seed link, an opposite parity mark can be given to any other
candidates that are strongly linked to any of the marked ones. Additionally,
when a candidate must be directly equivalent to a marked one, it can be marked
with the same parity. This usually occurs because both see the same group of
sister candidates, one of which must have the opposite parity.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SE: Start with a biplace value: a value with 2 possible places in a region.
Paint the first GREEN.
Paint cell-value also paints each:
  (a) the other place for value in this cells box, row, and col; and
  (b) the other value of a bivalued cell.

I think my "10 paces" rule partially implements "Additionally, when a candidate
must be directly equivalent to a marked one, it can be marked with the same
parity. This usually occurs because both see the same group of sister
candidates, one of which must have the opposite parity." but I'm not at all
sure what "sister candidates" are: I think it's two-or-three candidates, one of
which must be candidate, and in this case serves as a pivot, so that A is v, or
one of the "sisters" is v, such that if A then B, and conversely if B then A.

This explanation ONLY makes sense if you already understand it and therefore
don't need the explanation. A common complaint. Sudokuists suffer from a lack
of a common language; so that everything has to be defined in unambigious
terms, typically with example/s. I'm unsure what the "one of which must have
the <u>opposite parity</u>" constraint is about, so I cannot follow.

Conclusion: I think I'm missing MANY tricks here: I suspect there's a more
general rule that can be applied instead of my "paintMonoBoxs" method, I'm
just too stupid to understand precisely what it is.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is critical that the links used are truly strong; for example assume 5 has
just two places in a region, and those two cells have the possible values 135'9
and 2578. At parity(i) the second cell is 5, but we don't know where to put 5
at parity(ii) so, with no other evidence, it can't be marked. However if one of
the other candidates in cell 2 has the opposite parity mark 2"578, or if that
cell sees a cell holding 5", then it's settled: we can mark 5 in cell 2.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SE: This lines-up with the exclusion rules in #Medusa3D.txt.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Exclusion Rules

1. A candidate that can see cell mates and/or sisters of opposite parities is
   false. e.g. (34'9") makes 3 false.
2. When exclusions reduce a cell or house to a single marked survivor, that
   parity is true throughout. e.g. (26"7) makes parity(ii) true.
3. If two sisters or cell mates carry the same parity mark, that parity is
   false throughout. e.g (35"8") makes parity(ii) false.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. Got it.
2. 3D Medusa has no implementation of this. I'm struggling to understand it!
   I wish he used actual grid/s, with real examples. I get lost in the lingo.
3. Got it.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Marking Tips

Equivalence marks are persistent and can be extended progressively as other
methods are applied. However, being limited to just one pair of marks, they
will not show every available strong link until the clusters eventually merge.
It is consequently wise to evaluate which strong link cluster will be most
productive to mark (usually the biggest) at the start. It is therefore better,
and quicker, to run simple colour checks first, even though equivalence marking
will achieve the same reductions.

Should the deductions dry up, the parity marks can be extended to weakly linked
candidates using Graded Equivalence Marks.

Example

Equivalence_Marking_Example.png

Equivalence marking was started from (45)r9c5. In all but one case the marks
were made through strong links at bivalue digits in the same cell or bilocal
candidates in the same house. The exception is the marking of (8')r4c5 which
could be marked because it is directly equivalent to (8')r5c7 (green). From
the parity markings the bracketed digits in the orange cells must be false
because at one parity another candidate in the cell must be true, and at the
other, a sister candidate must be true in an underlined peer cell. This assigns
(5)r2c3 and (8)r1c8 as they both become singles. After handling the further
knock-on, basic exclusions, the marking can be resumed to find other
deductions, when parity(i) will be found to be true.

Graded Equivalence Marks

Occasionaly, someone comes up with a powerful solving techniques that recieves
a cool welcome by the general Sudoku community and disappears into oblivion,
 after their inventors have given up their struggle to defend it.
Graded Equivalence Marks could easily have fallen into this category if it were
not for David P Bird, who has repeatedly proven the power of this technique.
Yet, there is but a small group of people who actually use it. Maybe this
article in Sudopedia will convince other players by showing how this simple yet
powerful solving technique can complement their current solving toolkit.

Graded Equivalence Marks or GEM is an extension to Equivalence Marks. You
should read the article and make sure you understand the concepts before you
proceed with the graded version. Other prerequisite knowledge includes strong
links & weak links, clusters and parity.

GEM uses 6 different markers to reveal the implications of both choices in an
initial bivalue or bilocal situation. The 2 first-grade markers are the same
you would use in Equivalence Marks and the process to apply them is similar to
3D Medusa coloring on a single cluster. The 4 second-grade markers are only
used in GEM.

Since GEM is basically a dual implication network, it is bifurcative in nature,
which acts as a repellant to many Sudoku players. Yet, when a player simply
carries out the instructions, it's no scarier than any technique involving
conjugate pairs.

Markers

		Parity 1	Parity 2	Please Explain
Par		'			"			bidirectional links
Super	-			=			true when pars are true
Sub		.			:			false when pars are true

' Par marker for parity 1
" Par marker for parity 2
    The par markers are the same as used in Equivalence Marks. They represent
    the two parities in the initial cluster. The parities are mutually
    exclusive: One must be true and the other must be false.

- Super marker for parity 1
= Super marker for parity 2
    The super markers are true when the par markers for their parity are true.
    When their parity is false, their state is indeterminate.

. Sub marker for parity 1
: Sub marker for parity 2
    The sub markers are false when the par markers for their parity are true.
    When their parity is false, their state is indeterminate.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Use GREEN and BLUE as the two parities:
a) a green/blue "+" for super (to right of existing grey value)
b) a green/blue/red=both "-" for off (his subs are on the OTHER color. sigh.)
to fit-in with the rest of my mark-up.

Par markers are "strong" links, bidirectional "and conversely" relationships.
Super and Sub markers are "weak" links, or unidirectional relationships.
a) Super: If A (par or super) then B (super) DOES NOT imply if B then A.
b) Off: If A (par) then NOT-B (off) DOES NOT imply if NOT-B then A.
Do NOT mark -'s from +'s! It's invalid, so the logic breaks-down.

I'm calling supers "ons", and subs "offs", for brevity.

A table of the two parities/colors as per my implementation in SE
         GREEN       BLUE        Explanation
colors                           bidirectional links
ons      +           +           true when color is true (but not conversely)
offs     -           -           eliminated when color is true (not conversely)
In the GUI, +'s and -'s are painted the appropriate color to show there parity.

NOTES:
1. A color (par) is just the value in GREEN/BLUE, as per existing coloring.
2. An on (super) is a grey value, then a "+" in GREEN/BLUE. If "+" both colors
   then one of the colors is invalid, but which? So I throw OverpaintException.
3. An off (sub) is a grey value, then a "-" in GREEN/BLUE/RED=both
   My offs are on THIS color, where his subs are on the OTHER parity (WTF).
4. So GREEN or BLUE value for parity.
   '+' is on (super).
   '-' is off (sub). Simples!
This is best way I can think of to make the manual GEM markers fit-in with my
pre-existing rendering of coloring. I don't want to change Coloring, XColoring
and Medusa3D rendering just to suit GEM, and they really should look "similar".

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Initial Markup

The usual choice of seed candidates is a bivalue cell or a bilocal digit,
with the two exclusively possible candidates given opposite par marks.
Less frequently other seeding options are available, for example which of
two box/line intersections will hold a digit, where only sub markers may be
possible, but always the basis of a mark-up must be two mutually exclusive
conditions.

The method will show either:
  a) which one of the starting conditions must be true; and/or
  b) which individual candidates must be false under either condition.

Seed candidates should be chosen which are hoped will give the maximum return,
and time spent considering the best choice is worthwhile, as a complete mark-up
is time consuming.

Marking Opposites

As soon as a par or super mark has been given to a candidate, sister and cell
mate candidates can be given complementary marks of the opposite parity for the
type of link involved:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Medusa3D paint marks pars of conjugates and bivalue cells, but doesn't know
anything about supers or subs. A super mark is produced (may not be only case)
when sourceCellValue (srcCV) leaves one-only value in an effected region: so we
apply the "10 paces" rule (shoot back) and
    if that leaves srcCV.box with one-only v then
        create a strong link (as per Medusa3D)
    else
        mark effectedCellValue as an on (super) of the same color as srcCV.
Note that Supers can't be built-upon, unlike the actual colors, because they
don't uphold the "and conversely" rule, so they cannot be relied upon as the
basis for further logic. Supers only apply WHEN THERE PREDICATE IS TRUE, and
the predicate is NOT enforced when a consequent assumption hangs off it, so
everything goes tits-up! They can however be used to prove that a parity
contains contradictions, so they ARE used in contradictions.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Complementary Marks:
Par Grade:    Strong Link:  Par  <=>  Par   ( ' + "  &  " + ' )
              Weak Link:    Par   ->  Sub   ( ' + :  &  " + . )
Super Grade:  All links:    Super ->  Sub   ( - + :  &  = + . )
Sub Grade:    Strong link:  Sub  <=>  Super ( . + =  &  : + - )

Sub Grade Groups: When all but one of a set of candidates carry the same sub
parity, the final one may be marked with the complementary super mark.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* when all but one v in a cell is eliminated then the last v is super.
* when all but one v in a region is eliminated then the last place is super.
I think my concept of sub differs from the authors! To me a sub is an elim
caused by a par. I think he puts subs under the OTHER parity, which makes
absolutely no sense to me. Also I think he's saying that each Super offs all
other potential values of the cell, and all other places for this value in
each of the cells box, row, and col, which makes no sense to me, but I tried
it anyway, and straight away ran into insanity. It's NUTS!

WRONG: Super Grade:  All links:    Super ->  Sub   ( - + :  &  = + . )
is NOT implemented in my GEM implementation because it's nonsensical!
I tried Off'ing each On, as per colors.
	foreach On:
		Off each other potential value of this cell
		Off each other place in each of this cells box, row, and col
But it doesn't work! It breaks "and conversely": creating a consequence (which
do NOT support predicates) as if there was no predicate is just plain wrong!
To be clear, I think the spec is WRONG! I think the author expands this summary
in the following rules, but doesn't point that out. This summary line is WRONG!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For example, a cell marked "1:5:79:" becomes "1:5:7-9:". Note that such
inferences are a cause of contention with bifurcation purists, as the grouped
marks often stem from different forks. If this is a concern, use this condition
as an indicator that a recognised pattern, such as an ALS, may exist which will
achieve the same effect.

Marking Equivalents

Normally parity marking chains follow an alternating parity sequence, but
sometimes it is possible to mark cells which must be equivalent to one or more
marked cells. This happens when it is known that one of the three cells in a
line/box intersection must eventually contain a particular par or super parity
mark, so all candidates in sight of the full trio can be marked with the
opposite parity.

Promotions and Exclusions

1. When all but one cell mates or sisters to a par marked candidate have been
   excluded, the survivor can be promoted to a par mark.
2. A super grade candidate seeing a par marked sister or cell mate is promoted
   to a par mark.
3. A sub marked candidate seeing a sister or cell mate carrying a par or super
   grade mark of the same parity is false.
4. Two candidates with opposite parity par marks in the same cell make all
   other candidates in that cell false.
5. In a cell when all surviving cell mates have the same parity that parity is
   true.
6. In a unit, if all sisters of a digit carry the same sub parity, the opposite
   parity is false.
7. If two sisters or cell mates carry any combination of super and par marks
   for the same parity, that parity is false.

Note: when a parity is found to be false, only par and sub marked candidates
for that parity are excluded, not the super grade candidates.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Promotions
1. If all but one cell mates or siblings of a color are off'd
   then paint the survivor.
   1a. If all bar one value is off'd from a cell (all one color),
       then paint the last value (same cell) this color.
   1b. If all bar one place in a region is off'd (all one color),
       then paint the last place (same value) this color.
2. If an On has an OPPOSITE colored sibling/cellMate then paint it this color.
   2a. If an On has OPPOSITE color (same cell, any value) then paint it.
   2b. If an On sees OPPOSITE color (any place, same value) then paint it.
Eliminations
3. An Off seeing a sibling or cellMate colored/on of other color is history.
   3a. If an Off has OPPOSITE color/on (any value) then eliminate it.
   3b. If an Off sees OPPOSITE color/on (same value) then eliminate it.
   3c. All cell-values Off'd by both colors are eliminated.
4. If a cell has values of both colors then eliminate all other values.
Confirmations
5. When all surviving potential values of a cell are the same color,
   then that color must be true.
6. In a region, if all siblings of a value have offs of the same color,
   then that color must be true.
Contradictions
7. If two siblings or cell mates carry any combination of colors and ons of the
   same color, then the OPPOSITE color is true.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Marking Tips

Just as with other methods, the speed at which deductions arrive will depend on
the marking order used. Quick results on easy puzzles often come from just
marking the par grades first before extending the scheme to sub and super
grades. Then for moderately rated puzzles, a hare approach which restricts the
marking to certain groups of units holding a potentially useful reduction may
be best, but for extreme puzzles, the tortoise method of taking each digit in
turn and marking it to exhaustion avoids missing key inferences. Often the
casual eliminations made en-route will be insignificant to the solution, but it
is worth checking to see if they create naked pairs or box/line reductions
which can be acted on first before resuming the mark-up.

GEM Example.png

Here the marking was started from r5c5 and was restricted initially to par
marks only. To avoid over-complicating the figure, super and sub grade marks
have been started just for the 8s as shown by the coloring. At r4c2 the 8 is
conjugate to (8.)r4c1 and so is marked (8=) from which we get (8.)r17c2. At the
stage reached in the figure, (8:)r7c1 is the only 8 in the row with a
parity(ii) mark so it can be promoted. Because of the existing par 5', it
becomes (5'8") so excluding 3,6 & 7 there. This will also exclude the (8:) at
r9c3 so the cell becomes (4'7") with the 7 being promoted. On grade marking the
7s it will then be found that box 8 cannot hold a 7 at parity(ii), so parity(i)
is true which resolves 10 cells.
