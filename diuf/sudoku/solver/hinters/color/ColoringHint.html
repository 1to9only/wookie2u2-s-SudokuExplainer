Coloring is a unary (single value) forcing chain of regions with two places for
<b>{1}</b>, so {1} must either be in the <b2>greens</b2> or the <b1>blues</b1>.
Hence any {1} that sees <u>two</u> colored {1}'s is history:<ul>
<li><b>color trap</b>: any candidate which can see two cells of opposite colors
can be removed.
<li><b>color wrap</b> (rarer): if two cells of the same color see each other,
then all candidates of that color can be removed.
</ul>
<p>
Therefore <r>we can remove <b>{2}</b></r>.
