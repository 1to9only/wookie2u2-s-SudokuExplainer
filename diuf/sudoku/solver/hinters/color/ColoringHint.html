  <h2>HoDoKu {0}</h2>
  <p>
  Coloring is a unary (single value) forcing chain comprised of regions 
  having just two possible positions for the value <b>{1}</b>, so the value
  {1} must be in either the oranges or the blues, so any instance of {1}
  which sees two instances of {1} is on the chopping block:<ul>
  <li><b>color trap</b>: any candidate which can see two cells of opposite
   colors can be removed.
  <li><b>color wrap</b> (rarer): if two cells with the same color can see
   each other, all candidates of that color can be removed.
  </ul>
  <p>
  Therefore the following values may be removed: <b><r>{2}</r></b>
