<h2>{4}</h2>
<p>
The {0} cells <b>{1}</b> are the only possible positions of the {0}
values <o><b>{2}</b></o> in the <b1>{3}</b1>.
Because the number of cells equals the number of values, these {0}
cells must contain these <o>{0} values</o>, in any order.
<p>
Hence other values can be removed from these cells. It follows that 
<c>cell <b>{5}</b></c> is the only remaining possible position of
the <g>value <b>{6}</b></g> in the <b1>{3}</b1>.
<p>
Therefore <r>we can remove <b>{7}</b></r>,
and subsequently <b2>set <b>{5}</b> to <b>{6}</b></b2>.
<p>
<u>Explanation</u>
<p>
Note that "Direct" sets are just an agglomeration of two distinct hints.
It is just nice to see them both as one hint, and so it is, that's all.
