The BUG (Bivalue Universal Grave) class is superceeded by Coloring, XColoring,
Medusa3D, and GEM (Graded Equivalence Marks) because they all find more hints
in less time than BUG does. BUG should therefore be regarded as "deprecated".

I do not use BUG any longer; instead I use Coloring, XColoring, and GEM.
* BUG is slow and finds only the minimal coloring sets; those that outright
  invalidate the puzzle (ie a subset of contradictions, as eliminations).
* Coloring is the only one that does Multi-Coloring, ie searches more than two
  colors to produce a hint.
* XColoring extends simple (two colors) coloring to find more hints using some
  simple "extended" rules.
* Medusa3D colors cell-values, not just cells. It finds more hints than
  XColoring, but for reasons I do not understand Medusa doesn't find ALL of the
  XColoring or even Coloring hints, so I suspect there's something wrong with my
  Medusa3D and subsequent GEM implementations.
* GEM started as a copy-paste of Medusa3D, coz they're fundamentally the same
  problem, so GEM finds everything that Medusa does, and more besides. GEM is
  only a partial implementation of the Graded Equivalence Marks spec, which I
  can't understand, because I'm stupid. It finds many more hints than Medusa3D
  but I'm pretty sure it's still missing tricks coz I can't implement a few of
  the specified elimination criteria, because they make no sense to me: they're
  just gibberish. In fact the whole specification makes little sense to me. I
  would need to interview the expert who wrote the spec in order to get my head
  around the problem to write a comprehensive spec on the back of a fag packet.
  That's always been the way, since before Adams daddy identified a persistent
  itch. Viva La France!

Nothing is ever perfect.
