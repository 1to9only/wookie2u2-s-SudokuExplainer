  <h2>Unique {0} type 1</h2>
  <p>
   The cells <c><b>{3}</b></c> form a <b>Unique {0}</b> with the values
   <b><g>{1}</g></b> and <b><g>{2}</g></b>. There are exactly two ways of
   placing the values <g><b>{1}</b></g> and <g><b>{2}</b></g> in the
   <c>cells</c> of the Unique {0}, forming two possible configurations.
  <p>
   In both configurations, each row, column or box touched by the Unique {0}
   contains each of the two values <g><b>{1}</b></g> and <g><b>{2}</b></g>
   exactly once. As a result, if one of these two configurations were part
   of the solution, it could then be replaced by the other one to get a
   <i>second valid solution</i>.
  <p>
   Because a valid sudoku cannot have more than one solution, none of the two
   configurations of the Unique {0} can be valid. The only possible way to 
   avoid these two configurations is if the cell <r><b>{4}</b></r> does not
   contain the values <r><b>{1}</b></r> and <r><b>{2}</b></r>.
