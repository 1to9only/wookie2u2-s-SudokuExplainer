  <h2>Unique {0} type 4</h2>
  <p>
   The cells <c><b>{3}</b></c> form a <b>Unique {0}</b> with the values
   <g><b>{1}</b></g> and <g><b>{2}</b></g>. There are exactly two ways of
   placing the values <g><b>{1}</b></g> and <g><b>{2}</b></g> in the
   <c>cells</c> of the Unique {0}, forming two possible configurations.
  <p>
   In both configurations, each row, column or box touched by the Unique
   {0} contains each of the two values <g><b>{1}</b></g> and <g><b>{2}</b></g>
   exactly once. As a result, if one of these two configurations were part of
   the solution, it could then be replaced by the other one to get a
   <i>second valid solution</i>.
  <p>
   Because a valid sudoku cannot have more than one solution, none of the two
   configurations of the Unique {0} can be valid. Note that the two cells
   <c><b>{4}</b></c> and <c><b>{5}</b></c> are the only possible positions of
   the value <g><b>{1}</b></c> in the <b1>{6}</b1>, thus, one of these two
   cells will contain the value <g><b>{1}</b></c>. Therefore, the only possible
   way to avoid the two configurations is if neither <r><b>{4}</b></r> nor
   <r><b>{5}</b></r> contains the value <r><b>{2}</b></r>.
