<h2>Hidden Unique Rectangle</h2>
The cells <c>{3}</c> (A, B, D, C) form a Hidden Unique Rectangle:<ul>
<li>All four of these cells maybe <g><b>{1}</b></g> and <b1><b>{2}</b></b1>; and
<li>cells <g>B=<b>{6}</b> and D=<b>{7}</b></g> are the only places for
 <b>{1}</b> in at-least one of there common regions; and
<li>cells <b1>C=<b>{8}</b> and D=<b>{7}</b></b1> are the only places for
 <b>{1}</b> in at-least one of there common regions.
</ul>
<p>
The logic of all Unique Rectangles is if we set any cell in the rectangle to
either value, then we could swap it with the other value to get a <i>second
possible solution</i>, and because a valid Sudoku has one possible solution we
know that this combination is invalid, so we must eliminate one of these two
values from a corner of the rectangle. In a Hidden Unique Rectangle the cell on
the corner OPPOSITE (D={7}) the start cell (A={5}) looses the rectangle value
({2}) which is NOT locked into the two common regions; ergo {7} cannot be {2}.
<p>
Therefore <r>we can remove <b>{4}</b></r>.
<p>
<u>Explanation</u>
<p>
As explained above, one of the four rectangle corners must not be one of the
two rectangle values in order to avoid the second possible solution trap, so
we eliminate one of these values ASAP.<ul>
<li>If we presume that D ({7}) is {2} then both B ({6}) and C ({8}) will be
 {1} because they're the only remaining places for {1} in B-D and C-D; leaving
 the bivalue A ({5}) with {2}.
<li>But this solution is invalid because we can swap values {2} and {1} to
 produce a <i>second possible solution</i>.
<li>Hence we can remove {2} from D ({7}).
<li>"B-D" means a region common to both cell B and cell D, which has these two
 cells as it's only possible locations for this value (and likewise "C-D").
</ul>

<u>Explanation from sudopedia.com</u>
<p>
Suppose we have a rectangle with cells A, B, C, D, such that A and D (and B and
C) are in opposite corners, and either AB or BD share a box, and the cells have
the following candidates:<ul>
<li>A has ab, 
<li>B has abx, 
<li>C has aby, and
<li>D has abz, 
<li>where x and y are one or more candidates,
<li>z is zero or more candidates,
<li>and the same candidate may occur in more than one of these sets.
</ul>
Suppose further that B and D share a house such that they are the only cells
where candidate 'a' can occur, and similarly C and D share a house where only
they have 'a' as a candidate. Then we can eliminate 'b' from cell D.
<p>
How this works: If we assume that cell D has the value 'b', then both B and C
must have the value 'a', since these cells share a house with D where they are
the only other place an 'a' can go. Consequently cell A must have the value b.
But since none of the four cells in the rectangle is a given, this is precisely
the deadly pattern which allows two solutions: we could swap a for b in the
rectangle and still produce a valid solution.
Therefore, b can be eliminated as a candidate for D.
