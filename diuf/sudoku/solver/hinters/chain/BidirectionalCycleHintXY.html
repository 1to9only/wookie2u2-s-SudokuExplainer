<h2>Bidirectional Cycle (XY-Cycle)</h2>
<p>
The cells <c><b>{0}</b></c> form a bidirectional cycle: there are exactly two
ways of placing the <b><g>values</g></b> in these cells, forming two different
possible configurations. Some <b><g>values</g></b> appear in a box, row, or col
regardless of which configuration is correct. One of these two configurations
must be correct, hence other occurrences of these values can be removed from
these boxs, rows, and/or cols.
<p>
Therefore <r>we can remove <b>{5}</b></r>.
<p>
The two configurations of the bidirectional cycle are enforced by two
complementary, circular chains of implications. The details of each chain
are given below.
