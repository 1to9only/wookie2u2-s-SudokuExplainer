  <h2>{4} Multiple Cell Reduction Forcing Chain</h2>
  <p>
   With this solving technique, we will prove the following assertions:
<ul>
{0}
</ul>
   Because the <b><c>cell {1}</c></b> cannot contain other values, and the
   results are the same, we can conclude that <b>{2}</b>.
  </p>
  <p>
   Each assertion is proved by a different chain of simple steps.
   The chains can be dynamic, which means that the conclusions of multiple
   sub-chains are combined in some cases.
