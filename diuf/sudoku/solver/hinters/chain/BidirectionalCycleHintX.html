<h2>Bidirectional X-Cycle{2}</h2>
<p>
The cells <c><b>{0}</b></c> form a bidirectional cycle: there are exactly two
ways of placing the <b><g>value {1}</g></b> in these cells, forming two
different possible configurations. Some <b><g>{1}s</g></b> appear in a box, row,
or col regardless of which configuration is correct. Because one of the two
configurations must be correct, other occurrences of the value {1} can be
removed from these boxs, rows, and/or cols.
<p>
Therefore <r>we can remove <b>{5}</b></r>.
<p>
The cycle is an X-Cycle because only a single value is involved. X is a
value, so it's a variable, if you think that way. Bidirectional X-Cycles
are also known as Fishy Cycles or Bilocation cycles.
<p>
The two configurations of the bidirectional cycle are enforced by two
complementary, circular chains of implications. The details of each chain
are given below.

NOTE: if all hinters are selected all Bidirectional X-Cycles should (AFAIK)
be found BEFORE we call the Unary Chainer, So you should (AFAIK) never see
an X-Cycle hint. If all hinters are selected AND you're seeing an X-Cycle,
then one of the previous (simpler) hinters has missed a trick!
