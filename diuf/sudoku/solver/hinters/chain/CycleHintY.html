<h2>Bidirectional Y-Cycle</h2>
<p>
The cells <c><b>{0}</b></c> form a bidirectional cycle: there are exactly
two ways of placing the <b><g>values</g></b> in these cells, forming two
different possible configurations. Some <b><g>values</g></b> appear in a
row, column or box regardless of which configuration is correct. Because
one of the two configurations must be correct, <r>other occurrences of
these values</r> can be removed from these rows, columns or boxs.
<p>
This is a Y-Cycle involving only cells with two potential values.
Bidirectional Y-Cycles are also known as Forcing Loops or Bivalue cycles.
<p>
The two configurations of the bidirectional cycle are enforced by two
complementary, circular chains of implications. The details of each chain
are given below.
