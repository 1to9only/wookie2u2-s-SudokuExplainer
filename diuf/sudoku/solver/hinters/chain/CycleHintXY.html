<h2>Bidirectional Cycle (XY-Cycle)</h2>
<p>
The cells <c><b>{0}</b></c> form a bidirectional cycle: there are exactly two
ways of placing the <b><g>values</g></b> in these cells, forming two different
possible configurations. Some <b><g>values</g></b> appear in a box, row, or col
regardless of which configuration is correct. One of these two configurations
must be correct, hence all other occurrences of these values can be removed from
these regions.
<p>
Therefore <r>we can remove <b>{5}</b></r>.
<p>
This is an XY-Cycle, involving both regions with two places for a value, and
cells with two potential values (ie both chain types). Bidirectional cycles are
also called static nonorthogonal (ie not-square) loops.
<p>
The two configurations of the bidirectional cycle are enforced by two
complementary, circular chains of implications:
<p>
<b>Forward Cycle</b> (View 1):<br>
{3}
<p>
<b>Reverse Cycle</b> (View 2):<br>
{4}
