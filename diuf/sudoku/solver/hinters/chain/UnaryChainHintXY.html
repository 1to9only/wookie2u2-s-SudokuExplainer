  <h2>Unary XY-Chain</h2>
  <p>
   If we assume that {0}, it follows, through an XY Forcing Chain, that {1}.
   Therefore we can conclude that <b>{2}</b>.
  <p>
   Unary Chains start with a simple assumption that a cell is/not one of its
   potential values, which is proven to be either true or false.
  <p>
   X-Chaining means that:<br>
   (1) when a cell is assumed to be a value 
    then other possible positions for this value in this cells three region
    must be removed<br>
   (2) when a cell is assumed to NOT be one of its potential values 
    and there are only two positions for this value in one (or more) of this
    cells three regions
    then the other cell(s) must be this value.<br>
  <p>
   Y-Chaining means that:<br>
   (1) when a cell is assumed to be a value
    then all the other potential values of this cell must be removed<br>
   {2) when a cells is assumed to NOT be one of its potential values
    and there are only two potential values for this cell
    then this cell must be the other value.<br>

   The Forcing Chain consists of a chain of implications based on simple rules.
   The details of the Forcing Chain are given below.
