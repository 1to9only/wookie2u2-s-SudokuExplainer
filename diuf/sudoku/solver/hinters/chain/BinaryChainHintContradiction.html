  <h2>{6} Binary Value Contradiction Forcing Chain</h2>
  <p>
   With this solving technique, we will prove the two following assertions:<ul>
    <li>If {0}, then {1}</li>
    <li>If {0}, then {2}</li>
   </ul>
   Because the same assumption yields two contradictory results, we can conclude
   that the assumption is false, that is, <b>{3}</b>.
  </p>
  <p>
   Each assertion is proved by a chain of simple assertions.
   The chains may be dynamic, which means that the conclusions of multiple
   sub-chains are combined.

  <p>The details of each chain are given below. Use the view selector below
   the grid to switch between the <o>graphical illustrations</o> of the two
   chains.
