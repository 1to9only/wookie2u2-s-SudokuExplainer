<h2>{5} Region Forcing Chain</h2>
<p>
With this solving technique, we will prove the following assertions:
<ul>
{0}
</ul>
Because the value <b><g>{1}</g></b> cannot be placed elsewhere in
<b><b1>{2}</b1></b>, and the results are the same, we can conclude
that <b>{3}</b>.
<p>
Each assertion is proved by a different chain of simple rules.
The chains may be dynamic, which means that the conclusions of multiple
sub-chains are combined.
