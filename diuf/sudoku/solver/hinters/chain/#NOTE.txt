The chain package is the acme of the original DIUF Sudoku Explainer by Nicolas
Juillerat, which HEAVILY relied upon chaining to find lots of hints which can,
and therefore now are, found by simpler but slower (when added up) techniques.

2021-04-27 the current implementation has a funky design. AChainer implements
IHinter's findHints method to cache hints, delegating to actuallyFindTheHints
of each of it's two subclasses, UnaryChainer and MultipleChainer.

UnaryChainer finds single-value chains and bidirectional cycles.

MultipleChainer does all the rest; it finds chains on two-or-more values. It
handles "dynamic" chaining; where the state of the grid is updated to reflect
the current set of assumptions, so that we can optionally run hinters to find
eliminations that are applied back to our working grid. It even does nesting,
where one chainer uses another simpler chainer, so we're making assumptions on
our assumptions; which is always fun.
