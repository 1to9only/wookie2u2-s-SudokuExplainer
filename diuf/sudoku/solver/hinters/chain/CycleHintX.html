<h2>Bidirectional X-Cycle{2}</h2>
<p>
The cells <c><b>{0}</b></c> form a bidirectional cycle: there are exactly two
ways of placing the <b><g>value {1}</g></b> in these cells, forming two
different possible configurations. Some <b><g>{1}s</g></b> appear in a box, row,
or col regardless of which configuration is correct, and one of these two
configurations must be correct, hence other occurrences of the value {1} can be
removed from these regions.
<p>
Therefore <r>we can remove <b>{5}</b></r>.
<p>
This is a Bidirectional X-Cycle, involving regions with two places for a value.
X-Cycles are also known as Fishy Cycles or Bilocation cycles.
<p>
The two configurations of the bidirectional X-Cycle are enforced by two
complementary, circular consequence chains. The details of these two chains are
given below.

<p>
<b>Cycle details, reverse direction</b> (View 2):<br>
{4}
<p>
NOTE: if the coloring hinters are selected Bidirectional X-Cycles are found
before we call UnaryChain, so you will never see an X-Cycle hint. If coloring
hinters are selected and you are seeing an X-Cycle, then one of the coloring
hinters missed a trick. Nobody is perfect!
