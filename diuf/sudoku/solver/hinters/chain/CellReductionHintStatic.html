  <h2>{4} Static Cell Reduction Forcing Chain</h2>
  <p>
   With this solving technique, we will prove the following assertions:
   <ul>
    {0}
   </ul>
   Because the <b><c>cell {1}</c></b> cannot contain other values, and the
   results are the same, we can conclude that <b>{2}</b>.
  </p>
  <p>
   Each assertion is proved by a different chain of simple steps.
   The chains are static, which means that they do not rely on the conclusions
   of previous sub-chains.

   The details of each chain are given below. Use the view selector below the grid
   to switch between the <o>graphical illustrations</o> of the different chains.
