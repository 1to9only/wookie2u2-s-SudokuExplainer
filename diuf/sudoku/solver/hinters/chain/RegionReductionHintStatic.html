<h2>{5} Static Region Forcing Chain</h2>
<p>
 With this solving technique, we will prove the following assertions:
 <ul>
  {0}
 </ul>
 Because the value <b><g>{1}</g></b> cannot be placed elsewhere in
 <b><b1>{2}</b1></b>, and the results are the same, we can conclude
 that <b>{3}</b>.
</p>
<p>
 Each assertion is proved by a different chain of simple rules.
 The chain is static, which means that each step in the chain relies only on
 what we see the grid, <b>not</b> on the results of previous assertions
 (ie "Dynamic Chaining").

 The details of each chain are given below. Use the view selector below
 the grid to switch between the <o>graphical illustrations</o> of the
 different chains.
