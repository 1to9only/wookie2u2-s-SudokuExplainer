<h2>{4}</h2>
<p>
The only potential values for the <o>{0} cells <b>{1}</b></o> of the
<b1>{3}</b1> are the <o>{0} values <b>{2}</b></o>.
Because the number of potential values matches the number of cells,
these <o>{0} values</o> must be located in these <o>{0} cells</o>,
in any order.
<p>
Hence other possible positions of these values can be removed from the
<b1>{3}</b1>, which leaves <g>cell <b>{5}</b></g>
with the only remaining potential value of <g><b>{6}</b></g>.
<p>
Therefore <r>we can remove <b>{7}</b></r>,
and subsequently <b2>set <b>{5}</b> to <b>{6}</b></b2>.
<p>
<u>Explanation</u>
<p>
Note that "Direct" sets are just an agglomeration of two distinct hints.
It's just nice to see them both as one hint, and so it is, that's all.
