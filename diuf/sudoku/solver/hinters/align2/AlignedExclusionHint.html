<h2>Aligned {0} Exclusion</h2>
<p>
The <c>aligned set <b>{1}</b></c> is aligned around the <g>excluder cells <b>{6}</b></g>{7}
<p>
The <c>aligned set</c> can hold various combinations of values, but some combos
are not allowed because either:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RULE 1: same value in two sibling cells in the <c>aligned set</c>, or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RULE 2: this combo leaves an <g>excluder cell</g> with no potential values.
<p>
Some potential values do not occur in <u>any</u> allowed combination, ergo they
have been excluded, hence they can safely be removed.
<p>
Therefore <r>we can remove <b>{5}</b></r>.
<p>
<u>Justification</u>
<p>
The following combos are not allowed in the cells<br>
{1}:<br>
{2}
