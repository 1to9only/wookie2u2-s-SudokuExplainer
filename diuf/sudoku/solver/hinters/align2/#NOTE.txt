!!!! align2 IS PARTIALLY USED !!!!

The align2 package was written to replace the align package debacle. It's an
attempt to do AlignedExclusion far more succinctly. align is boiler-plate crazy,
and align2 is simpler and works but it's slower; so align is preferred.

To use align2 instead change LogicalSolver.configureHinters.

Note: the two packages operate independently of each other: each package has all
it's own "supporting" classes. Classes with the same names have the same origin,
but may now differ in content. Diff them to find out.

2021-04-27: align2 now used for A234E, where it's a bit faster than it's boiler
plate counterparts, but it's still MUCH slower for A5E+ where the original align
package, if anything, is used. For the most part I simply don't use A*E any
longer, because it's too slow, and the majority of it's hints are detected
further up the hint-stack. I won't use A*E until I find a way of implementing it
that's atleast an order of magnitude faster; no small order.
