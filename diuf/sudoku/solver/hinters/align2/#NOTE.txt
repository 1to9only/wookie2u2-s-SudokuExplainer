!!!! align2 IS NOT USED !!!!

The align2 package was written to replace the align package debacle. It's an
attempt to do AlignedExclusion far more succinctly. align is boiler-plate mad,
and align2 works, but it's slower; so align is preferred. To use align2 instead
change LogicalSolver.configureHinters.

Note that the two packages operate independently of each other: each package
has all it's own "supporting" classes. Classes with the same names have the
same origin, but may now differ in content. Diff them to find out.
