/**
 * An Ass(umption) is an assumption that a Cell will/not be a value. The class
 * name is shortened just for convenience, and comedic effect. Wait until we
 * wewease da Kraken. Effit!
 * <p>
 * This class is used in diuf.sudoku.solver.hinters.chain (everywhere) and
 * {@link diuf.sudoku.solver.hinters.fish.KrakenFisherman}.
 * <p>
 * Stores the Cell, value, and isOn; as well as the hashCode which uniquely
 * identifies this combination in 12 bits, which is a 2048 HashMap, which is
 * many more than ever actually add, but my hashcodes most significant bits
 * are right-most so you really want just 8 bits (64 Entries) to reduce the
 * collision rate so that get and add are "pretty fast". But, the larger the
 * HashMap table the slower the constructor. Everything costs something, but
 * normally get times far outweigh constructor times, so be generous!
 * Play with your initialCapacitys to see what works-out quickest.
 * <pre>
 *      1 2 3 4  5  6  7   8   9  10   11   12
 *      1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512,1024,2048
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Optionally stores a list of parent (causative) assumptions. The full chain
 * can be found from the last item of the chain (the target) by following the
 * parent references back the the source (which has no parents), hence this
 * class may also represent an entire forcing chain of assumptions.
 * <p>
 * We also optionally store a cause, explanation, and nestedChain. See the
 * attribute for details.
 * <p>
 * <b>Voluminous:</b> Asat 2019-10-11 We construct 849,531,749 Asses during
 * a LogicalSolverTester run over top1465.d5.mt in "normal" ACCURACY mode, so
 * the performance of the constructor code itself (especially the 2nd one) is
 * bloody critical to the performance of Chainer, which is critical to overall
 * performance, in the GUI as well as LogicalSolverTester.
